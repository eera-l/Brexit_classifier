0	After leaving you want friendship with all nations and relationship. Hahah no!!! Leave means leave. Thats how you wanted.
0	Everything that was ever promised in connection with Brexit: sunlit uplands, easiest deal in history, cheap shoes, £350m a week for the NHS, was a lie.
1	Hail Britannia! From the USA!
0	Please. Stop. All this being lied to is exhausting.
1	European its just good on the paper and when they speak but action are far away of that :) like Farage say : We love europe, we just hate the european union ! <3
0	Britain economy will end up like Britain car industry
0	It will be a nightmare
1	EU was ALL ABOUT POWER + MONEY
0	Hi, I am another German. I am very pro European integration. I would like something better than the EU but that's what we have to work with.  On one side I would like it, if the UK would be with us in this effort. For the talent and strength the UK could bring to the table, i am sad to see them leave.  On the other hand, experience has shown that the UK actively hinderes further integration. The whole process of Brexit has shown, that even most remainers are only in it for their own benefits. That's why I am happy this unfortunate relationship is ending, and the rest of the EU can face the future without worrying about the family diva all the time.  And as final note: I as a rational person, believe in  science. Part of that is experiments. If Brexiteers are right and I as a Pro-EU-Federalist am wrong. I want to see it. For that reason i am happy about Brexit. As it gives all sides the real world answer to what is better. With that in mind I am even prepared for the breakup of the EU in case of a Brexit success.
0	We left. No regulatory alignment or there’s no point of leaving
1	2:07 Farage worked against the European Union, which is what you have to do if you love Europe.
1	I think that's one reason why people who have personally watched it change from the EEC into what it is now are more likely to be leave voters.
0	"Men will be proud to say 'I am a European'. We hope to see a day when men of every country will think as much of being a European as of being from their native land"  Churchill had it right. Leave voters have little knowledge of history, and even less knowledge of what they voted for.  The whole country shafted by ignorant fools, many of whom will lose their jobs, and the rest of whom don’t care because they’re being paid by the state. Not for much longer when the money dries up.
0	I'd like to congratulate Brexiters on making us a vassal state for the next 11 months. A country of rule takers. And of course after that you can celebrate us becoming a vassal state of the USA.
0	Access to expertise, (medical/technological...) is the main factor in human survival rates. That makes respect for expertise an evolutionary imperative. The overwhelming majority of experts told us not to Brexit, making it an evolutionary failure.
1	Goodbye evil EU hello new better world
0	We already could trade virtually everywhere. And on very favourable terms by dint of having EU clout behind us. Now we are minnows waiting to be snared by little nets. EU “red tape” is a Golden Chisel into foreign markets.
1	the only people moaning about brexit are the remainers who havnt gotton thier own way. keep throwing youre teddy out of it cot... yall pathetic
0	I thought about 'giving up'.  The battle is still very much on. Bozo is looking like trying to deliver some abomination of brexit that nobody voted for.  I think we're going to need protests.
0	After 47 years End of German-France Dictator in EU.  Free UK.
0	It seems that Ireland, in the north and Scotland had other notions !
0	It's a shitshow in the same vein as our President, and a lot of people didn't know what they were voting for.
0	The fact you think one can have their "nose rubbed in diversity" speaks mountains about what a small minded, unpleasant person you are. Who are you going to blame when you can no longer blame immigrants?
0	Boris should spend this year planning for no deal because that's where it is heading.
1	The territory of fascism creeps ever nearer.
0	If they wanted to leave EU that's ok but Brits should be greatful to be part of EU, without it they would be much much poorer now
1	All, we will be introducing words of the week and words of the day for the next year. We suggest our followers use them when possible. The word of today is BREXIT The word of the week is BREXIT
1	And now it’s time for a Nexit. The dutch are sick of it too, even though the MSM says they aren’t.
0	Free from what? Free to do what?
0	Gonna miss my Europe buddies.. :/
1	Why do people act like the first referendum was undemocratic and like it never happened... Man the disconnect from the people vs the government in the UK seems to be pretty blatant. Just leave the EU already.
0	They wont have a chance without the rest of Europe ....
0	#BrexitJohnson - reneged on promises to #RedWall Tory seats (shifting £ north to south) - revealed £12bn black hole in public finances - attacked #PressFreedom - began implementing #FuckBusiness policy - started citing God in speeches  How have 1st 4 days of #Brexit been for you?
0	Imagine when history looks back at this event and they play these leavers on tv?? What the hell will they think of us as a society? This will definitely go down as the "moronic age"
1	So much for the Remoaner lie that the UK would have to apply to join the WTO then.
0	Brexit. Voting to 'Take Back' what we had never lost, In order to lose Everything we currently have Well done Brexiteers for downgrading the lives of all of our children and all of their children.
0	Tinged with regret, wishing that Brussles had only listened? Fabrication is your way isn't it? Brussels was never the problem. You were.
1	Finally we can be free of the EU grips and we can make this county great again
0	Donald Tusk, *former* President of EU Council, gets 15 minutes to undermine Brexit (such as by encouraging Scottish independence) • Nigel Farage, who made Brexit happen, gets 2 minutes on Marr Sofa.
0	A beginning to disabled people not being able to afford food, legal people being deported, and schools running out of funding...
1	Other Eu states will follow when we make a success of it.
1	lets face it the Eurocrats want us to stay owing to the fact that we pay £350 million quid a week to belong to the EUssr. we could build and staff a few dozen hospitals for one years fees?
1	congrats mates
1	I have never seen so many stupid  people all in one place ( although there was only one brain cell ).  WE voted out and now there are more countries of the world to trade with than there was being locked into Europe. The one thing this country lacks is patience they act like Americans we want it all and we want it now ...............well things do not happen like that we have voted we are leaving Europe so back off and wait for the out come like the MOST of us that voted to leave. I do not care how we leave they will need us more that we need them. Europe was full of corruption ripping us off and it went to the very top.
1	The folk in the member states are now seeing how afraid the companies in their states are of UK companies becoming direct commercial competitors. They are, like the "elite" of the only trading bloc in the world with delusions of grandeur, running scared.
1	"Let my people go!" For how long EU commission mocked,  snubbed,  bullied and blackmailed Great Britain... And finally,  after long stifling political prevarication, the moment of liberation! The gulp of fresh air!.. Congratulations!
1	Breaking news:WERE ALL GONNA DIE
1	They gambled. And the end result? Al 'Boris' Johnson with an 80 seat majority.
0	finaly :D bye bye uk :D good luck :D
0	An act of economic stupidity based on xenophobia and Tory lies. The UK will rue this day! Hopefully Scotland charts an independent path back to the E.U. now that this Brexit folly has come to pass
1	EU lost almost 20 billion per annum
1	Let's get behind it and be positive about the future, otherwise feel free to leave!
0	Very sad indeed. One day we will return EU.
0	You just gave Johnson a massive majority to be as corrupt and incompetent as possible.
0	Sorry for all my British friends today. I hope you’ll soon return too our flawed, but still quite okay European Union. Wish you best of luck in the coming months.
1	I voted leave and would again A leave vote means more chance of Scottish independence, at which point Scotland can join the EEU & Schengen
1	The poll also reveals that a majority of people believe Brexit is a “big enough change”
0	Honestly even though I don’t the UK being made fun of, I can see why people would. This situation is pretty wack.
1	The deal been offered is terrible for us, I’d rather we take our chances and leave with no deal than accept a bad one, the EU will collapse without our money anyway
1	It’s back to the Belgae for you soon Brutus and no more of this shit !
1	The EU will be bankrupt once our payments cease. They desperately need our money and won't last without it.
1	Great Britain has been made great again! Congratulations
0	Tonight Brexiteers will creep down stairs and steal the dreams, hopes and wishes of future generations #BrexitEve
0	It'll directly affect my life so I've been watching along closely. I'm an American living in the UK and I'm married to an EU citizen. So depending on what type of deal there is (which is seeming much more likely than a no-deal at this point), it'll determine whether we stay in the country or not.
0	The move only favors the rich not the common man.
0	Are we about to see the greatest brain drain in history?
1	I want to leave the EU. I just don't like being part of it. Its not based on economic studies, immigration or anything like that. I just don't want to be part of it the same way i prefer Rugby to Football. Why do we need to have such complex arguments for these things. I want Great Britain to be truly independent, then i want a real trail blazer of a party leader to win the next election and i want this mess of a country sorted out once and for all. Seriously, whats so wrong with just going it alone? Treat the country like a startup....great things could happen.
1	Brexit is the beginning of Great Britains Independence
1	THIS IS WHY WE LEFT AND WANT TO BE OUT COMPLETELY
0	British do not come to Spain for vacations please, bye bye!
0	2 years from now, no one will ever admit they voted for Brexit.
0	One of the good things about Brexit is that I feel more European than ever! Under 30% of the population voted to chain the younger and educated to their flawed political, conservative, defensive, post-colonial ideology based on feeling and emotion rather than economic sense. 73% of 30 year olds and younger are pro remain. Leave a light on Europe, we'll be back!
0	This being an international site there are plenty of people who are far enough removed from the situation too to see this and post and comment accordingly
0	With brexit UK could risk losing a wave of investment, and with it, a raft of new technologies.
0	Let’s wait and see how this goes shall we? PS. Boris where are the tax cuts for us £80k earners?
1	Happy Independence Day, United Kingdom! It's good to see the Mother Country get up out of the muck and stand upright again.
1	End it, unelected people I have never heard, I think they are all crooks, and a bunch of frauds
0	There are times when I fervently wish Britain would exit the EU because I would love to hear the Eurosceptics arguments when it finally dawned on them that the EU was not responsible for the UK's dire housing problem, its creaking NHS and lack of social mobility thanks to a two-tier education system that works against the poor.
0	Hahah that is hilarious. The UK must be about to discover some new industry that everyone is going to want and cannot replicate. The UK has been in steady decline for a long time, isolating itself through Brexit will just increase the pace of decline. They will be begging india for help soon. Hilarious..... oh the humiliation they will feel
1	London and New York are, financially, larger than the next 5 global financial centres added together
0	What, post Brexit, are they going to do that will make a substantive difference, that they could not do today?
1	Whatever we offer wont be good enough for EU.
0	I know lying worked to get us out of the EU but a bit less obvious next time.
1	congratulations to the U.K for gaining back their sovereignty and freedom
0	Thats all Brexit supporters are capable of lies and vile abuse, keep it up DM.
0	Johnson has claimed that a comprehensive trade agreement can be done quickly and has vowed to make Brexit a success. Barnier has claimed that the transition period is to short for a major deal and that Brexit is bad for both parties.  If there is no deal and the economy tanks, who will look stupid? Who will therefore be desperate?
1	We’ve lived with it both ways [inside and outside the EU] and I think a lot of people were fed up with these regulations and being ruled by people we didn’t know
0	BUT WHAT ABOUT THE STUDENTS?
0	I think Brexit is overall a bad idea, and the way it has been handled has made the situation even worse. However, a second referendum would not be a good idea. They don't work. We just got fucked by one. We elect governments with the intention that they will work on our behalf to do the best for the country. Stop letting us role the dice when we don't know best and it's not our job.
0	We can’t vote our way out of this. We are, always will be European.
1	Tonight magic has happened. All remainers have been turned into leavers. Happy Brexit everybody.
1	My word this is good. Our country has a great feel to it. Makes one proud to be British again.
0	This is a messy divorce!
0	As a Brit,  Brexit breaks my heart.
0	This is what full employment looks like???, minimum wage jobs and zero hour contracts!!!...Yet these people blame the EU???, this is squarely down to the intransigent tory government...
0	Remain.  I want my daughter and her future children to have human rights that  Cameron (et al) has been trying to erode. If we weren't in the EU we'd  be even more spied on than we already unreasonably are.  Voting leave might as well be signing up to have cameras installed in  our houses, recording everything like we are criminals. Leaving won't  solve immigration at all, nor will it solve any of our  financial issues, especially those caused by poor tax evasion management  and an unwillingness to change the loopholes.
0	Iam all for skilled EU workers as they pay taxes to support my pensions and dividend income-get Sweating!!
0	#StopBrexit #Remain #StoptheCoup
1	Brexit has strengthened the EU, Thank you England!
1	pathetic... i am saddened and embarrassed to be British
0	Unless the EU collapses in the next crisis the UK shot themselves in the face.
1	You people really act like countries don't exist outside the EU. Hahahaha, fear here, fear there.... Fear fear everywhere. People who are afraid don't make rational choices. They don't reason or listen TO reason.  You're all wrong. Britain will recover and when it does you'll be in your 'special place' holding your blanket and asking big 'Ol daddy Brtain for a handout.  The people saying the young people's futures are ruined, are you fucking serious? You can't be......... The EU has done NOTHING to improve educational standards or help struggling students... Nothing. The EU doesn't care for little people, at all. It cares about power for powers sake. You have Junker calling for an EU army...........WTF people. Get a grip of yourselves. Panic panic panic.
1	I have no regrets what so ever. The EU is moving closer and closer to becoming a federation.
0	now that uk is the enemy we should destroy there economy.
1	The UK doesnt need to be bound up with the rest of Europe.
1	Well he's right I do support #Brexit
1	For me it was trade. The UK is the most globalised country in the world. We have have more direct investment from abroad than anywhere else. The Chinese businessmen, the Russian Oil Tycoons, the Arab Sheikhs have been buying up property and businesses in the UK for the last 10 years at breathtaking speed. It's seen as a safe and growing option. We are afterall the fastest growing G7 nation.  Switzerland has a grand total of 27 Free Trade Agreements with 38 of it's trading partners. The EU has managed to sign just 4 so far. The EU with it's 28 voices and red tape makes negotiating deals a slow and tiring process.  No wonder the Swiss enjoy such High Per Capita wages and great quality of life. Remember they are a landlocked nation surrounded completely by EU member states. If they can do it with the 8 million population. Then the UK with it's 65 million population, 5th largest Economy, and Rank 1 of the G7 growers definitely can.  The future is bright. The future is Britain at the forefront of a Globalised world.
0	They will still be miserable hedge, pothole, noise complainers in the morning. Soon the deep realisation will set in, it wasn't the EU making their lives miserable. EU was propping up a country living a lie.
1	Finally, it only took us.. 4 years
1	Lucky you, I wish we were leaving too (Italy)
0	All I can say is, I hope you folks know what your doing.
0	Sad day for Britain.
1	You have your own waters, EU. Keep out if ours. The free lunch is over, messieurs. Come back only if you want your nets cut.
1	be independent, stop relying to EU... good job UK
1	Man, all these clueless and ignorant people commenting about leaving the EU 😅 Leaving the EU is a very good thing. I just wish my country would do the same. Well, technically we're not in the EU, but we still have some arrangement with the EU.
1	You Remainers need to realise one thing, we are leaders not followers, the following liberal snowflakes have had their day, it’s time to move aside & let the real patriots take control.
0	No Brexiteer has said it will be a success for over a year apart from obviously mongs on the internet - because everyone knows such statements will come back to hurt them real bad during the recession/depression.
1	I don't doubt that someone has said this earlier in this thread but I haven't read all the comments - so I say (in the words of that great patriot and Prime Minister, Winston Churchill) - this is not the end, nor is it the beginning of the end, but it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning. With no disrespect to our European neighbours, and with no wish to hark back to memories of earlier, more conflicted times, the 'democratic' majority of those who voted here in the UK to leave the EU have had their voices heard. Churchill also said We are with Europe, but not of it. European type politics of deals done behind closed doors has never been the way of Great Britain and the signing of treaties by successive Prime Ministers (who liked only Executive Power and who should have known better) without the expressed will of The People has, hopefully, been stymied forever. Ditto Parliaments and Speakers who think they are above and beyond the reach of the Electorate
0	I will not support Brexit as I can see no benefit to it
0	Not remotely possible for me to ever come together with you. Brexit has made me so miserable. You are responsible for a great amount of sadness, anger and confusion in this country.
1	Great another deal that will be thrown out just for the sake of it, not saying it’s good or bad just get on with it and get it done
0	Going through with Brexit as it stands now is simply stupid, there's no suggarcoating it
0	I run an aircraft repair company. So I'm pissed off as I've had to move my base ops along with my family from UK to EU as the threat of restrictions on work, travel import, exports & visas as there's already people being given short Visa stays even though they've been in the UK paying well above average taxes for over 15yrs. So to all my Staff they feel uncertain as if there's any friction it'll cost money which equals jobs. Equally now I'm on the continent it's far easy to get around and now and have clients in countries that were put off before from the high pound value.
0	How long until we are back in again?
0	It would be a bloody stupid thing to do. I sincerely hope the British people have enough sense to kill off the idea.
1	Now that brexit is out the way. Let’s finally get round to legalising weed
1	Yes!!!!!!! They finally had the brains and balls to do it! Goodbye EU....Socialist governments
1	The British have chosen liberty with Brexit and can congratulate themselves every day.
1	We will defend our islands (and Gibraltar) - whatever the cost.
1	The problem is that we have several countries with very different economies, sharing the same currency. We saw in 2011 during the Euro crisis how much some of these countries struggled (PIGS).
1	The Irish should leave the EU too, otherwise accept a hard border.
1	EU bureaucracy can't help itself, a trade war is looming .. We must be prepared for the inevitable no-deal .. And we are ready .. Better a no deal, than EU submission.
1	As BREXITEERS, we just want what we, the majority voted for! I have never wished harm on any remainer..they are entitled to their opinion but have to come to terms with the fact they were out-voted!
1	The best thing Britain has done is leave the EU, should never of joined in the first place. You just wait and see.
0	As far as I am concerned, it is getting better continously thanks to EU.
0	Why do brits always fight and argue. Cant they be civilised like the rest.
1	Keep up the good work Boris! 17.4 million are behind you!
0	More people will die from the Brexit chaos than ISIS would have dared dream of - Brexiters are right up there as clear and present dangers as vital drugs don't get through etc
1	They've got their confrontation and conflict.
0	There is no plan for making Brexit work. Brexit was a project that was weaponised by Boris johnson to become PM, now that he has finally succeeded, he's boxed himself in. His whole credibility now rests on making a success of what was always a wild gamble based on nothing but grandstanding, thin air, and the backing of one maverick economist (Minford) who nevertheless admitted that 'Brexit will decimate agriculture and manufacturing in the UK' and he said that as if it was a good thing.
0	Hahaha good luck standing alone against US, China and India.
0	Brexit is Putin's dream come true - he wants to destroy all of the western countries and alliances.
1	Neither side can hurt the other without injuring itself. The fundamental precept above underlies everything. This is why the naysayers, the doomsters and the gloomsters cannot be right in their negative predictions. As the negative folks may see it, back when the EU renegotiated the Withdrawal Agreement, Boris pulled a rabbit out of a hat. However, the reality was he stayed strong in light of the fundamental precept mentioned above and the EU ultimately had to give us a better deal as it was ultimately in their own interests. This time around we're starting in a much more positive and respected position than Mrs May's negotiating team ever got to so I think 2020 will end with Britain getting a fantastic trade deal with the EU but also many other trading partners for 2021 as well! Good times are ahead for the UK!
0	No Brexiter will be missing the EU, they're too busy feeling like a winner for the first and last time in their sad little lives.
0	I’m still waiting for someone to outline one single benefit of leaving the Eu
1	the U.K. should just forget about the EU and only do trading with the USA :D we will take care of ya'll... just relax some of your laws :)
1	I don't know if Brexit is the right decision or not, but I can at least see the reasoning behind it as well as the appeal. I'm also not a fan of the EU.   I support the UK's decision either way and hope for the best.
0	I like the idea of peace but with different economic laws and values and some not using the euro
1	:D :D <3 <3 Farage is a true leader
0	Please leave out the anoying topic of conflict between British and Germans. You re related. And both great nations and admirable democracies. We wish we were British or Germans. Stay in EU. NO ONE will ever challenge the position of UK as a top economical and financial power.
1	This is the whole point of “funding” from the EU! Where did they get the money from in the first place? Would you deposit £1000 in your bank to receive back £800 and then say “ Oh thank you how wonderful you are” ? Not bloody likely is the answer, but this is exactly what we have done for 47 years! Incredible isn’t it?
0	this brexit thing is totally a mess – what a disaster for both parties!
0	Only a insecure country feels tiny by an economic trade union
0	Never mind the NHS Collapse granted
1	We dont like STRANGERS in our local england do we tubs?,this is a local country for local people!
0	Believe this is simply taken the amount paid and not the net contribution that would remove the money received back from the EU?
0	Hahhahah little brexiteers at it again! This country will go down the pan with this deluded and crazy women in charge! I am educated, I listen to James O'Brien on LBC between 10am to 1pm every day, so I know what I am talking about. Please vote for the person who is most likely to beat the Torries in you area. I am back Jeremy as he is my local MP and hopefully soon to be prime minister under a Lib Dem - Labour coalition. With the lib Dems on board we will, together stop this madness and reverse the mad decision made last June. We can then begin to rebuild this once beautiful loving country. #Make June the end of may!
0	Good news, iv just come back from 2029 and there is no BBC TV licence. There are new laws on biased news reporting, and fake news. And crime has dropped by 30% .
0	With Brexit there are no victors, we all lose.
1	I think it should be recognized that Brexit was an amazing victory against massive odds by the ordinary people of the UK. Remember during the run up to the election the amount of Lovies and leaders who spoke for Remain. The whole of the British Liberal Elite, President of the USA, the Pope, the BBC, just about every actor and celebrity, and many many more. There followed three years of Brexiteers accused of not knowing what we voted for, brexiteers overnight became Bigoted fascist racist Little Englanders who had stolen their children's future and destroyed the Union. I feel so proud that we were so instrumental in defending democracy and becoming a Sovereign Nation again. Congratulations to all Brexiters.
1	I have a lot of friends here. It’s a great political year in America. So I expect to be here a bit
0	Yes, that's what we teach our children. Still, this decision was allegedly made by "adults". It will be up to the children to fix the mess their parents made through their lack of maturity.
1	The EU is the beast rising out of the sea having seven heads with seven crowns upon their heads, the book of revelations speaks about it. You can not buy, sell, or trade without using their s system.
1	Very happy about it. And not just because it gets us out of the EU, but also cause the radical progressives and socialists got crushed in the election.
1	Serious reply. I'm Irish, and I've lived in the UK 4 Years for work. The country, for whatever reason, gave me the ability to vote in the election. Even in Ireland, we only let irish nationals vote on things like constitution changes. But England gave me the right to vote. And there's a lot of fucking history between Ireland and England. So I used that vote to Vote Leave. Mainly because it would be hilarious! It's still hilarious. I have now gone back to Ireland.
1	Yep we don't need the EU and its corrupt un elected Twonks. I'm voting OUT!
0	Are you speaking on behalf of those UK businesses dealing with EU partners
0	The UK all the so gets money from the EU.
1	Should have shown EU sour grapes.
0	#Brexit The Crown virus!
0	Brexit. How depressing. Who thought this one up?
0	BREAKING: The wilful ignorance and lies of those who promoted passing Brexit will now be adopted by those running Brexit.  Weren't EU countries UK's biggest trading partners last week? Just checking for a friend...
1	Hope all countries break away from eu. It's nice to travel abroad but not to be dictated by the dictators, there is only one solution, to become AUTONOMOUS
1	I favour something closer to a Norway style arrangement with the EU and therefore I would still be a Brexit supporter.
1	Brexit will be the best thing that happened to the UK for decades
1	Freedom, sovereignty, self-determination. The biggest day in British history since the end of World War Two, and a huge victory for liberty
1	God bless you you have taken your country back
1	Here is the thing: the Europeans have done NOTHING to stabalise the eurozone, they've made things worse by passing the 2016 bail-in rules.
0	United we stand, separate we fail. It is always easy to leave the boat when it smells ashes but leaving is weak and selfish.
0	All of this is because parliament ignored the will of the people.
1	One thing I did like about the EU was the check on the bastard faction of the Tories fucking us over too quickly. Ah well.
1	I feel so sovereign again
0	Who cares
1	The EU, in its current form, is unsustainable.  It WILL collapse. Brits were smart to want out. But I fear the powers that be are desperate to hold their power.
0	Their economy will crash simultaneously with ours. Putin must be getting tired of celebrating.
1	Remainers - its over - move on We have a Country to rebuild
1	each Maltese citizen has 15 times the power of each UK citizen to decide the laws that regulate the EU and therefore the UK
1	I'm just glad we're out of that french dictatorship
0	People celebrating in London were asked to take an IQ test. They all accepted and started queueing
0	The reason it happened at 11pm is bc that is midnight in Europe. If we were pushing the EU around - it would have been midnight UK time - surely? We have taken back nothing - just made fools of ourselves and weakened the UK for 100 years.
0	Nations and sovereign states have the right to decide what to do with their future. Leave the EU is as rightful for them as it is to leave the UK for Scotland. It’s not the solution though. It’s just one of the consequences of the horrible way the fat cats of Europe have been managing the union. Austerity policies and excess of nationalism are to blame.
1	As a non-Brit observing the referendum, I was a staunch supporter of Remain. Since then, I've become somewhat more sceptical of free trade and the European Union, although it's just as obvious now as it was then that Brexit was an opportunistic attempt at careerism for most of the Leave leaders, that's gone horribly off the rails. It's an international case of schadenfreude that the UK will never live down. If another vote was held today, I would be a reluctant Remain supporter.
1	Good people of Britain. Take back your country from the mudslum hordes that crowd your cities and populate your welfare rolls. Lose the failed EU affiliation, It has only hurt your country and opened your borders to invaders.
0	i didn’t want brexit to happen but let’s see what our future has got for us
0	England will be poorer and tourists won't want to be here. There is no future in brexit.
0	Looking forward to welcoming an independent and social democratic Scotland to the EU. And while I feel for the middle and working classes in the rest of Britain, ever more at the mercy of the rapacious privateers, I expect that the punishment meted out by the EU will serve as a deterrent to further secessionist folly, strengthening the union and weaking right populism.
1	What's wrong with training the people that already live here
1	Now leaders can Make Britain Great Again without the EU sucking Britons dry, flooding their cities with terrorists masquerading as refugees.
1	Boris is the messiah who will lead us out of the EU
0	It's dumb and it doesn't feel thought through.
0	“leaving the EU” is a mistake for certain and first and foremost in how it is being executed. This way it cannot be but a failure.
1	Tough luck Remainers, you have held this country back for almost four years now with your petty antics and blockades. It's our time to shine now and gain our rightful place on the world's economic and political stage. The sleep lion is about to roar.
0	Brexit is what happens when a false sense of superiority combines with a false sense of victimhood
1	If we don't need a trade agreement with them don't bother wasting time negotiating one . Personally I'm sick of the EU and their mind games.
1	Mistake? The only mistake was getting shackled to the bloated EU corpse.
0	It honestly never ceases to amaze me how this shit and Trump all happened in the same year.

0	I will always be a European. I will always think, and act, and move through the world as a European. I will always live by the values of inclusion, kindness, community and solidarity. #Brexit is a Crime Scene. One day the real tale will be told. #StillEuropean #AlwaysEuropean
0	England will need to apologise for generations for allowing this tragedy to unfold.
1	No we not having second thoughts. We want out of the EUSSR
0	You were duped by Russian hacking and misinformation, too. It gave us a clown president and it took you out of the EU.   We are and will forever be brothers.
1	How the media took one side and ensured that people couldn’t accept a referendum and two general elections
1	Corbyn is unbelievable, he will disagree with everything, , he needs to stop, we voted to leave over 3yrs ago, and it isn't right that we are still being ignored,

0	Name a single benefit of leaving the EU. Go on, name one
0	This whole Brexit shambles has brought embarrassment and humiliation upon us Brits. I am deeply ashamed of my country, but immensely proud of being a Citizen of Europe (at least for the remaining 6 hours). But I'm sure we WILL be back!
1	there are benefits of Brexit such as reducing immigration and the ability to not be subjected to unnecessary and bureaucratic regulations/laws made by a supranational body of which some elements are unelected/undemocratic.
0	Seriously Simon? How many pro-Brexit articles have you written over the years? You're an educated man,wasn't this stuff obvious from the start?
1	Mass immigration was forced to destroy national identity, so all member states could integrate better.  Their goal was to make the UK and France indistinguishable.
0	Brexiteers should not be allowed to vote, too dump.
0	You can do all of that inside Europe, you just don't want to and are holding the country to ransom. For that, you will either be a footnote in history or never forgiven.

0	If you genuinely think leaving the EU by virtue of a 52-48 one-time non-legally binding public vote without any idea how things are going to be after you leave and still want all the good stuff that comes with being in the EU is a good idea, then I have some real estate on the far side of the moon I’d like to sell you.

0	"approximately 80% of Britain’s businesses don’t trade with EU member countries but only within the UK or with none-EU member countries" That is not quite the whole story. Virtually all major businesses trade directly with the EU. All the companies in their supply chains trade indirectly with the EU. In those supply chains there will be tens of thousands of small companies that technically only trade with a domestic firm, but in reality they will still have to conform to the same requirements as the larger firm.  There is almost no company that doesn’t depend on EU trade, either directly, indirectly through B2B trade or indirectly through consumers whose jobs depend on EU trade.  Virtually no SME expects lighter regulations. If there was a list of the regulations that would be changed, we would know by now, but there isn’t. The problem is that the regulations that could be changed are not significant, as virtually all significant regulations are actually quite popular.  The harsh truth is that - with the exception of the financial sector - the UK government has virtually always chosen to regulate harder and stricter than any other EU member state. This was never required by the EU. Without the EU, it’s quite possible that regulations will just be easier to pass or change.  The facts are not balanced. Brexit has no upside overall, and the sectors that will profit (and there must be some) are hard to predict. We don’t know what the UK economy’s comparative advantage will be, a few years after brexit. No one does.
0	How is leaving one of the biggest markets in the world good for the UK?
0	Security costs money, so it's perfectly reasonable to insist that the EU pays towards the costs.
1	Britain's version of Declaration of Independence. Now they know how we in USA felt way way back when. Now we have even more in common. Congratulations to Great Britain! WOW!
1	Freedom 😀
1	Well done Boris you delivered this far, now show your EU counterparts that you mean business. If they do not wish to negotiate in good faith, tell them to do one, and go no deal!
0	The EU wasn't created until 1993.  Britain got along just fine before and will do O.K. after.
0	BBC This morning on Brexit.  Michael Gove tangible benefit of Brexit  'Gives us the opportunity to 'level up ' the north. Huh? is that it?  You could have done that 5 years previously while a member of the EU. Deceit and double talk from the Brexit govt.
0	jobs will be lost as a result of brexit.
1	Finally, all countries should leave the EU
0	I used to think that brexiters generally were despicable, semi-literate, socially dysfunctional xenophobes with no grasp of economic reality and with little understanding of the fundamentals of a parliamentary democracy. Now I just think they're just sad and delusional, and blissfully unaware of the tsunami of ordure coming their way.
1	We have left. They are in no position to demand anything.
1	I have a new respect for my cousins across the pond . Farage , we need people like you in the U.S Congress !! Come here ! Cheers & Beers
1	The remainer claim that they wanted a ‘no deal’ Brexit has failed to materialise because it is, and always has been, nothing but an attempt to scare people into voting for remain supporting political parties.
1	We should leave the EU and form a new trading block with the nations of the commonwealth. I'm not afraid of leaving the EU in the slightest. If they need us they can come knocking cap in hand. That's the way it will be not the other way round.
0	Lots of Brexit supporters are still complaining, about the EU, 'remoaners' and everything else.
0	I would never say this man was thick. I have respect for his views and admire the way in which he put them across. But he does clearly show a lack of understanding of the principles of the EU and the bigger economic picture #stopbrexit
1	Can't help thinking, if the EU is such a utopia, why do so many people risk their lives crossing the Channel to get out of it? These people come from complete shit holes, but after a few days in France they'd rather die than stay there. ROFLMFAO
1	bit.ly/WhyRemainLose Why the remain campaign will ultimately lose #Brexit #LeaveEU #BeLeaver #GOGOGO #VoteLeave
0	Its amazing to see that there is so huge class difference in the UK. People left on their own... Fighting to survive day after day. Its like in US. This is not European spirit. This is predatory capitalism. Few have more than they will ever need while the rest is living of the scraps.  Leaving EU is just going to make things worse, but it's obvious that no-one cares about the future of UK.
1	Immigration quite honestly. Soverignty too.
0	The right to live and work anywhere. This has benefited me greatly.
0	We are to face a risk of a cliff edge, in particular for trade.
1	I don't hear many good reasons to stay that we can't do ourselves
0	In my humble opinion Brexit is the single most stupid adventure besides the middle eastern wars any western country has thrown herself into in the course of the 21. century.
0	June 23rd I’m voting to remain in the EU what about you? RT if you agree.
1	We need a Prime Minister like President Trump who will take us out of the EU now!!
0	Next week, we'll be voting in the local elections. You may think it has nothing to do with #Brexit, but you'd be wrong. It will be a powerful indicator. Remainers must vote and they must vote for #proEU parties @LibDems #TheGreenParty. Please note: The Labour Party is #proBrexit.
0	Brexit has never been advocated by what it would give to average Britons, but rather by what it would take from the "others" like the EU, eastern Europeans, and "brown people".
1	The EU has failed to do its job. GB will be absolutely fine after we leave
0	Brexit Brexit.! We love u brexit.!
1	Hooray for Britain! Hooray for Brexit! Hooray for freedom!
0	It never was. It was the will of Boris so he and his American friends could get richer. Only 40% of Brits, if that, voted for Brexit.
1	I voted for it because it was the right thing to do. Doesn't personally benefit me.
0	It’s a tragedy.
0	Yay! Now Brits can all sit in a secluded little British world of British people telling themselves how special and unique being British is!
1	I feel happy, I feel so sovereign now.
1	Save Brexit, hang traitors.
1	The EU is a democratic disgrace - laws are made by an unelected elite and its parliament is weak.
0	What's behind the "strained relations"? A desperate need to present a monolithic establishment as at war with itself
1	We want our pubs back!! Bring the taxes down, who sets the taxes I bet it's them European we want beer will can afford!! We want our pubs back!!!!
0	Michel Barnier has warned that UK goods entering the EU will be subject to border checks
0	Don’t compare Brexit to jumping of a cliff either. Call it liberating ourselves from the cliff. We are free from the evil grasp of the cliff and free to move freely! Doesn’t matter about the lack of wings, we’ll sort that little detail out later.
1	The European Union is toxic
0	Brino Brexit is a smokescreen to appease baby boomers, many of whom won't be around in 5 years when we quietly undo May's deal and rejoin the EU without any of the hullabaloo of the past few days.
0	Why is Theresa May so afraid of a new election and let the Briton vote again? After all, the Britons were lied with false pretenses leading to the voting of Brexit
1	I’m celebrating Britain’s Independence Day!
0	Brexit’s worse than I thought
0	My only hope is that the sight of the UK sailing into the sunset with flags flying and sinking into obscurity actually makes the European project stronger.
0	My God im moving back home soon and im terrified,,
1	OUTSTANDING! Another direct hit to the global socialists.
0	Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning
1	Happy New Year. Enjoy your well earned celebrations
1	Who said #BREXIT was not about racism and Xenophobia?  Proud to be British eh?  Sovereignty eh? Freedom back eh? happy?  #HappyBrexitDay  #voteleave  #HateCrime
1	I've come to the conclusion that despite all the evidence to the contrary that Britain will be a country to be proud of once again, remainers will continue in this vein because they are followers, never leaders. They are suspicious of anyone who is successful and optimistic. Their misery prevails as it doesn't entail any effort on their part. The continual same old comments show a repeated mantra as they can only copy each other.
1	I think it is great that Britain is following democracy and will be free. As a NZer I feel we are much closer culturally and historically to Australia, Samoa, Fiji, Tonga, PNG etc. than Britain is to many European countries, but I'd hate the thought of being joined politically. Freedom is more important than wealth.
1	Rejoining with OUR commonwealth cousins and friends AT LAST, who are growing much faster than the isolated, stagnant EU.
0	Poverty....welcome in uk
0	Well Done Boris Johnson.😡😡😡😡😡😡😤🤬 UK will suffer and regret this! Edit: Guys it’s my opinion🙄😲😲😲
0	NO , Britain is one of the most important EU countries . Britain is very good for EU development . Really bad if Britain decide to exit EU .
0	Quite sickening how this brexit vote - engineered by a tissue of lies - is causing so much chaos. The BoE had little option, but ultra-low interest rates are hardly to be welcomed - especially by savers. The sooner we reverse brexit the better.
1	We work as a UK it will work
1	2019 and the latest election shows that  brits didn't change its mind
0	Commission website clearly states they have control of the agenda, only they can initiate or, even more importantly, repeal bad laws. Some civil service. The parliament is elected, but they have a binary choice to vote yes or no, so they all vote yes to preserve their project and their expense accounts (still no receipts required or even publication, TI said it was "hugely disappointing"). Not a mature democracy. How much introspection has the EU engaged in since 2016? Not a lot. Seemingly incapable of reform whilst the Commission holds so much power. The member state politicians seem to love being able to pass the Commission's laws, which they can then blame the EU for if they prove not to be popular.
0	When it inevitably doesn't work out it'll be the fault of all the remainers for not believing hard enough
1	Congratulations!
0	The UK's biggest blunder.
0	Leaving the EU will not solve any of your problems. The only thing that will definitely change is that you won't be able to blame the EU for everything which goes wrong in your daily life. You will experience how 450 million Europeans feel about the British behaviour when going on your next holiday to Spain, Italy or Greece. Enjoy your splendid isolation while we await Scotland to rejoin the EU in the near future.
0	British education system needs to be restructured.
0	Ah, look at all of those old, blithering idiots waving their flags of the Union Jack like simpletons. Only 5-7 more years until 3/4 of that crowd kicks the bucket lmao.
1	Now i can sleep easy because i know all of this is really going to help me out somehow
1	Brexit is good for the world
0	Well, hold on. It hasn't gone through yet, and won't for several years, and there's many a slip between cup and lip. Boris might get run over by a bus!!!!
0	Brexit is a vampire, sucking the nation's life blood. But the earth turns on. And 2018 is the year in which the Brexit vampire will meet the bright sunlight of reality.
1	If I were Boris I wouldn’t give a penny to EU end of story.
1	Go boris we are behind you all the way
1	Look at the Rrreeeee from some of these tools who think freedom is bad, how being happy to have your independence is bad because something... these idiots think the EU is everything yet they know nothing about it, they think the EU gives them anything outside of taking your money and restricting what you can do and what your country can do.
1	Congratulations from the USA for getting out of the socialist mess
0	If some 12 to 24 months from now we find the country is doing very well, we have great new trade deals and are at least as well off, let alone doing better, I will very happily come on these pages and admit that I was wrong and you Brexiters were right.
0	So soft brexit is basically not leaving the EU at all
0	Absurd reply by Johnson when journos ask him about the possibility of no trade deal: "We already have a deal....and it's a great deal!" He gets more like Trump every day. #BBCNews #Brexit
0	Hopefully the license fee will be next and you liars and propagandists can go and earn your keep for once.
0	Brexit was and is on Putin's agenda. Stop it NOW.
0	Now it’s not the time to campaign to rejoin. But we must keep dream alive, especially for young people who are pro-Europe. I hold in my heart the knowledge that I'll be back in this chamber celebrating our return to 💚 of Europe.
0	Worth bearing in mind that as well as endorsing far right parties, Tory MP Daniel Kawczynski is deeply corrupt.
0	Brexit is the UK decay
0	Leavers seem to occupy an alternative reality to the rest of the country and are driving us of a cliff edge because all they see is a road winding through sunny uplands.
0	I think it's going to get a lot worse before it gets better. Scotland is likely going to leave, the Troubles are going to rev up again, and the various unintended consequences are going to be felt for decades.
1	Celebrating "Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations" by burning a flag
1	I still don't enjoy the idea of the european union and I particularly don't enjoy the was that it operates
1	Hell yeah you can try to join us UK you were always our brother same with Canada
0	Today is the beginning of UK self destruction
1	No one knows what it will be like when we leave Europe as it's never  happened before. I'm a leaver. I'm against the EU anyway as it's nothing  like what we actually agreed to sign up to back in the 70s.  Personally I think we will be fine. There are many other countries  around the world that are fairly strong economies that aren't members of  a wider community such as the EU.  It's getting these idiots that want to remain as part of the EU to see this.  As with the current situation with our government, they are trying to  get as much money as they can, as being part of EU, bags them a other  wage, and a larger pension compared to if we wasn't in EU.  As for EU itself, they don't want us to leave, as we are 1 of  probably 4 or 5 countries that are wealthy enough to support the EU, as  all the other countries are far weaker, and getting constant handouts  from those 4 maybe 5 wealthy countries. If we leave, that pressure will  be on 3 or 4 countries.  Basically it's all about money. We will be far better off without the EU telling us what we can and can't do.
1	We may have a new Prime Minister, but businesses are still none the wiser on Brexit with less than a 100 days to go until 31 October..
1	Access to British waters is traditional only in the last 47 years. So paws off! Our food standards are better. Our animal rights are better. Our workers legislation is better. Our Prime Minister is better. Our people are better. So bog off. How dare they make demands. We are a free and Independent  Nation, like Australia, or Japan. Again...bog off.
0	every single government projection and forecast I have seen - and that’s A LOT - says Brexit is going to be a disaster
1	Norwegian here, we have done fine without the EU (even though we are in schengen), the Britain will do fine too
0	In principle, I am a remainer, and do not support the UK leaving the European Union.
1	Well, personally, I am delighted that I can have a possibility of handing a sovereign state over to my children as is their birthright
0	Boris and Raab are just going their usual tub-thumping gaslighting routine. U-turns, re-interpretations, pre-accusations of mal-intent, divide-and-conquer at home and abroad. And pre-conditioning the masses for the blame game. Same old, same old.
1	Get rid of the ultra emission zones
1	Desperate remainers trying to make us brexiters look bad no doubt
0	I was Remain for a long while, then for a minute or two I teased with Leave before snapping myself out of it.  I'm sure that the EU might be weaker without the UK, but the UK would definitely be weaker without the EU.
1	The UK has regained her liberty, freedom, & Autonomy. Now she can represent her own citizens interests!!!!
1	The U.K. has just taken its full seat on the WTO today.... 👏👏👏👏👏 And it’s rightful place on the world stage. Now that didn’t take long.
1	Let’s get one thing clear, personally I in no way believe that all those who voted for Brexit are racist or stupid. People voted based on the information (albeit limited and misleading) put before them by politicians. We could just as easily have arrived at a result by counting belly buttons. Innies Vs Outies. Turns out we are a nation of outies.
1	Yes lets Get Brexit Done ASAP! Parliament Democracy vs the People Democracy, where Parliament democracy Use the excuse stopping No Deal, where its NO Brexit & delaying a GE vs the PEOPLE, that want the Ref, implemented.
0	Damn your way of debating is so inefficient no wonder your empire fell appart
1	Britain will obviously not go into mayhem when this is all over either. Employment is decreasing, the economy is growing steadily (but not by a lot, I will concede) and the World Trade Centre will ensure that countries not in some economic, political mens club aren't in the dark.
0	Now UK has no one else to blame :-)
0	Ohh the poor England with no money had to leave the eu
1	Happy Brexitday. I hope we will folow you with a Nexit soon
0	The Brits are just as dumb as 30% of the U.S. population
0	Remainer luminaries periodically begging Sinn Fein to save them from Brexit was always one of the more nauseating parts of the anti-Brexit campaign.
1	The EU doesn't really have any negotiating strength left. The UK is free to pursue their own trade agreements with individual countries in any fashion they prefer, as well as deny EU fisherman access to their waters.
0	FUCK BREXIT.
1	happy days are here again
1	the eu can't push us around anymore
1	We eat our fish and EU eats theirs. BTW, EU catch more fish in UK waters that UK catch in EU waters
1	Britain will be an example of how everything massively improves once one gets rid of excessive meddling bureaucracy.
1	Brussels will now find they have much less importance in the world absent Britain.
0	I'm wondering whether I should give up and not give a crap about my fellow Brits, on the basis that if they won't help themselves, why should I invest myself. But there are a lot of people who need help and didn't ask for this.
0	Anything to help his mega rich donors. Brexiteers can’t seem to see what is obvious to everyone else. The EU were a bulwark against U.S. type capitalism, it was a force field that the extremist right in this country despised. You reap what you sow, you’ll soon find out exactly what Britannia unchained is all about for you and your family personally.
0	SF are less populist than the Brexit wing of the Tories. SF hold a high line against anti immigration policies and against racism & anti lgbt stances. Not necessarily what it’s “base” might what. They are economically populist. And I’m not a fan of SF but credit where credit due
0	Anyone surprised ? Weaker country, weaker currency How anyone thinks the we can get a better trade deal than the one we have just given up, is beyond me.
0	With Osbornomics in full flow the shock of leaving the EU will send us into full recession, but as long as we get our "sovereignty" back it'll be worth it...
1	Bottom line is many countries are outside the EU and they are doing just fine
1	Why is global supporting the EU instead of Britain? Cherry picking interviews? The people voted overwhelmingly to leave why skew the issue?
1	A most historic and beautiful day in British history. Freedom, friendship and prosperity. Good luck to all the nations of the eu. There is no more remainers and leavers only Britons. X 🇬🇧 X
1	Do you want Brexit with that?" "Brexit is a way of life"
0	parasite farage is a disgrace,  he tap into the weak and told them what to think and how to feel, and who to blame for their problems, people voted for a dream lace with lies and haft truth, i feel the UK will face a harsh reality
0	Against.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lump_of_labour_fallacy
0	There are plenty of people who voted to stay in the EU who don’t have degrees. The problem with trying to articulate the reasons for voting leave is that there aren’t any, the leave campaign was solely based on meaninglessness slogans and emotion - not facts.
1	Seen lots of people losing their followers and having to start afresh, so let’s do this again.
1	EU council is the cause of Brexit
0	My vote is going towards peace, prosperity and togetherness. Vote remain!
1	I like the idea of the EU and despite wide spread calls for reform they seem to fall on death ears. Whilst I agree that staying in it is the best way to achieve reform, ultimately its needs a catalyst and Brexit might achieve this.
1	Leavers will be happy now.
1	Boo hoo hoo. Am I supposed to feel sorry for Traitors, sellouts and collaborators now? They cried. So what. They can stay there
1	Why haven't we left yet
1	Why I'll be voting to leave the UK Reason 1: Security  http://bit.ly/EU-Security
1	The EU is corrupt, it’s the Nazis all over again. Trying to take over the world using economic means rather than bombs. Do we really want to be part of a global fraternity that is so evil and corrupt.
0	Agree no deal, let’s start to Export Bananas and privatize NHS since there will be no money!
1	It's #BrexitDay - the day our great nation finally breaks free, leaves the EU and becomes a sovereign, independent, global Britain once again.
1	Britain is going to be fine.
1	Reminder that #Brexit hasn't led to the mass exodus of City jobs that some feared - and few signs it will either.
1	This is how democracy dies... with EU funded nobles overruling the people
1	yeah, THE REALITY OF BEING FREE OF THE EU
0	Brexit has defined the death of colombia, and that will bring horrible problems to uk.
0	I don't really see what UK will gain from leaving the EU. I think it's better to be part of a larger union and try to improve it rather than leave it and then get screwed over.
1	Boris has achieved, what looks like a great deal for the UK
1	Scrap the bbc tax now
1	Let's make the most of this glorious opportunity we have before us ! Let's now all pull together , let's work together !
1	Nigel is the true hero of it all.
0	The "leavers" lied about everything
0	The British public will regret the brexit vote. Unity is strength.
0	This is awful! Why do they do this?
0	we will be able to do what we want' - something tells me that won't be the case.
1	Good morning, and what a wonderful morning it is, what a great day it will be, what an amazing future we have ahead of us. It is #BrexitDay, well done everybody - fifteen and a half hours to go. #Brexit🇬🇧 - Quitters never Win, Winners never Quit!
0	Isn't funny how UK says EU bullys them and restricts them but when they turn around and do it to the Scots it's not seen as bullying and restricting Scots but their right on Scots? Aren't humans so predictably biased towards themselves without giving a thought to holding themselves accountable! It boils to one fact and all say it simply you cant keep shouting about rights of u dnt talk about your responsibilities! 20 century marked by nonsensical one sided conversation about all talking about their right but no one talking about responsibilities lying with each side of the argument! Thts the only bloody problem. Aim to strike a concious balance between rights and responsibilities and you will realize the world appears absolutely different. Being committed to reslove issues than being committed to be on the right on every effing thing!
0	Just stop brexit now...... until I sell my UK house. Then you can brexit all you like. I've done my bit for you lot, so I'd like to buy a huge bag of popcorn and watch the show !
1	It's inherently unstable, it has to keep improving or it'll end.
0	Stay in because I value freedom of travel and work higher than a very  minute risk of terrorism and POSSIBLE net econonomic loss. I've been  alive a long time and never had trouble with a "foreigner" as far as I  can anecdotally tell most act on best behaviour until they integrate  properly.
1	5 people run the EU. Reason enough to get the F*ck out
0	Something for all you brexiteers to remember, one of the greatest Prime Ministers this country ever had, Winston Churchill, called for a "United States of Europe" and while that is by no means what the EU is it was better than anything we have ever had before. Enjoy your special 50p Coins while you can, our currency is about to tank and become all but useless buying anything from abroad.
1	Freeeee Britain yeaaaaaaaaaa
1	I voted out, knew exactly what I voted for and have had zero regrets voting leave!! Utter horseshit that leave voters regretted their vote. Total bollocks.
0	The thing is that no one is gonna protect them if some country goes to war with them
0	The whole thing is just so unpatriotic. Trump and Putin are rejoicing. We've stuck a knife in the heart of the most peaceful and forward-thinking alliance in the world, in which we were a leading voice and power. We were winning as a nation, people wanted to join our society and way of life. It's the frightened ones that couldn't get their head around change so just wanted to shut the door that are unpatriotic and have let down the country. It's not much of a stretch to say the UK (led by the Tories) have done a pretty shameful act.
0	I barely hear the news...haven't since GE2019. No need  EU are stronger & play by rules Trump & China R stronger We're weaker & Johnson lies Crap or No Deal Labour, LibDems, Greens can't win unless they become 1 new prog party. We have Rights Removed w/o Consent #Brexit is sh*t
1	Leave.  I like the people making laws that I have to abide by to be  accountable to me and the rest of the public. We haven't yet been  allowed to veto any of the laws the EU puts through, and we don't get a  vote on who runs the EU. It's a dictatorship with fewer executions.
1	The people have beaten the establishment. The real winner tonight is democracy. And I am someone who believes we should be pro-Europe, but not the European Union
1	Britain has broken the European shackles
0	The  EU must feel like they are negotiating with a mentally disturbed child  who spends most its time shouting incoherent nonsense to appease the  derranged voices (aka leavers) in its head.How  can you have a negotiation with someone who is completely detached from  reality and lacking any self-awareness regarding their current  predicament?
1	Great job UK. Globalism is a failed idea. The world is safe when all nations are strong prosperous and self dependent
1	there is only one solution, to become AUTONOMOUS
0	Many Leavers have not yet twigged that it will be several months before Brexshit hits the fan.
0	My God, what utter stupidity. People don't know why they are cheering.
1	Globalism just benefits big corporations. Only National govetnments can have theit peoples best interests at heart, not Brussels bureaucrats.
0	So the UK goes from being a second rate power but part of a very important European Union, to being isolated and totally irrelevant in the modern word. But frankly, my dear, who cares!
0	Everyone deserves to be free! congratulations!
0	We’re unwrapping the twelve lies of Brexit
1	When the European people wake up they will realise that the EU has evil intentions and will want to leave it as the UK did.
0	I hope people starve and are unable to get their necessary medicines as a result of Brexit.
0	“don’t fix something that isn’t broken”
0	If only they have thought about consequences before voting for it but no.Good luck with Boris and his lying government to sort out everything.Sure he will do everything he has already promised cuz he never lies haha
0	I'm going to say thanks to the next person I see picking up rubbish, that guy has a great point. It's the little things
1	"Europe’s nations should be guided towards the superstate without their people understanding what is happening. This can be accomplished by successive steps, each disguised as having an economic purpose, but which will eventually and irreversibly lead to federation."  Jean Monnet
1	We did not even have a chance to join the EU, they just made us and now we have to pay millions
1	I suggest all remoaners go and live in Belgium .
1	I'm worried that 'crime is easier to deal with' ignores the fact the EU has made crime easier in the first place (the terrorists atrocities for example)
0	They got here because people fell for the lies of Charlatan Farage and filthy toilet paper The Sun. That's how dumb it is.
0	Johnson & Tories know what a crock Brexit is & when the pain starts to be felt, they will need a sustained anti EU media message to cement their propaganda
1	Britain is reclaiming its agency as a self-governing nation.
0	My greatest worry is that same UK will not allow other nations to leave a failed union like Nigeria
0	Get him sacked, end the referendum silliness and keep Britain IN!
1	Time for the European union to be history! once and for all! Europeans! Take your country's back NOW!!
0	Still waiting to hear what the actual benefits are of leaving the EU.
0	Stay, better for people, economy & environment
0	Still European, always European # Brexit
1	Notice how the BBC didn't show Nigel's speech, they just showed him being scolded and then whatever that Irish woman was saying. He hasn't destroyed Europe as she said, what is she even talking about? Just spewing more EU crap. And that Nichola Sturgeon is a trouble maker, just like Corbyn.
0	I am so glad remain will win. I might even invite a family of migrants over to celebrate. Bye bye Boris the loser.
0	I’m done with it. Done with caring and trying to make my country a better place. People were lied to and they took it in.
1	The Socialist Fascists in Brussels are no longer the boss of Britain.
1	EU is run by pure evil tyrants. IT's needs to fall for the sake of Europeans.
0	The lorry incident a few days ago indicates there is much more important work to do than fiddling about Brexit whilst pissing away tax money.
1	No matter how much money George Soros pumps into the anti Brexit campaign,  or how many tears are shed by the likes of Tony Bliar, There will not be a peoples  vote. We've waited 40 years to get out of Europe. The remain campaign came out  with so many lies, as did the unelected EU leaders. They laughed at Farage when  he suggested the EU want a European Army. Now Macron has said in public,  that he wants a European army.
1	More the reason not to let them fish in any of our waters
1	Bring on to a new era 2020 U.K. being independent and being a country to be proud of.
1	These hundreds of regulations are a huge burden on small businesses and each one comes with threats of punishment by way of fines of thousands of pound
0	The fault for this Brexit mess lies fairly and squarely with Cameron for his weak leadership in failing to deal with the growing anti-EU feeling that developed within his party when he became leader. He should have launched a root and branch clear-out of all eurosceptic MPs, and reformed local Conservative associations that were moving in a direction to campaign for UK withdrawal from the EU
1	Brexit is stupid idea ..waste of time .until now no one give a clear idea what is going on .
1	Congratulations on getting your fisk back Britain. The EU is a big evil fish kikelord, we always knew. Always scheming to get your fisk.
1	Remember the scallop wars? Looks like round two is a possibility
0	Comb your fucking hair
0	Trade deal? Lol! Nothing will L be done. There will be nothing granted by the EU. WTO it will be.
1	People want sovereignty and their vote respected.
0	let's see for how long those people will celebrate in UK
1	I'm really glad the UK left the EU.  I don't know why Scotland would want to join the "pit of vipers" EU.
0	People need to realise that the EU referendum isn't about immigrants, it's about human rights. Leave and we have none
1	Yup, leave the EU
1	The U.K. Have got the opportunity to turn the last 47 years to a distant memory, forward and onward.
1	Realism and reality is certainly not appreciate these columns by those diehard pro-Remain fanatics who have not yet been cured of their Europhilia.
1	What a sad day
0	How leaving can be anything other than disaster
0	Thanks you older generations for ruining the future of younger generations such as 16 year olds who weren't allowed to vote :) P.S. The older generations will die before they see the consequences of their leave vote. Also older people are more likely to be xenophobic and less tolerant of migrants so more likely to be manipulated by the leave campaign to leave. Saying "all immigrants will disappear" even thought immigration from outside the EU is more that immigration from in the EU and we've seen how hard immigration is to control.
1	Happy Independence Day
1	Desperate times for the EU. Brexit has exposed the political power behind the surface bonhomie. The EU needs to modernise before it becomes any more like the Soviet Union.
1	The negative comments on brexit are the brain washed masses desiring to return to their unelected euro overlords.
1	Seeing this video I am more proBrexit than ever
0	What is going to happen once every European state leave EU and become independent ? USA, Russia and China can’t wait to see EU demolished.
1	Well done UK! Love from Australia. May this be the reemergence of a new Commonwealth. UK, Australia, New Zealand and India
1	The little guys actually got their country back!! Wonders never cease!!
1	Degree apprenticeships can help fill post-Brexit skills gap
0	#Brexit opened Pandora's box Mr Peston, it made it possible to be a complete and utter arse, a cheat, a liar, a law breaker, and get away with it. Not only that, it got wrapped up as 'charisma', 'straight talking' and became a vote winner.
0	Trying to use language to manipulate perceptions of reality. Delete the B-word? Done.
0	Let's face it, #BorisJohnson says one thing one day, something else the next day and something else the third day. His only consistency is that he LIES all the bl**dy time!
0	I did my Master and PhD in Economics in London. I am personally very sad about Brexit.
0	Nigel Farage said that he is for common market etc., but that they don't need European Court of Justice. Question then is: How would compliance with common market rules be enforced without a European Court of Justice? If a country stops treating others according to the rules, what remedy would there be? You need a court to rule on such disputes.
1	Its the other unmentionable that needs keeping out.
1	It's the start of a brave new "Brexit" world. Looking forward not back.
1	We across the pond are very proud of you. I caught myself singing Rule Britannia.
1	Leave  1) I have three governments currently. The EU / EC / EP / CoE , Westminister and Holyrood (Scottish Parliament).  Why on earth do I need to have three lots of bureaucrats making a  nice salary where one parliament works for most countries outside the  EU.  2) Despite being a member of the EEA and Union. Britain has  consistently been outvoted or vetoed when we try to put forward  legislation to benefit us. Even trying to get trade deals in place means we have to have the  blessing of all member states in the EU. Meaning deals and negotiations  takes years upon years.  3) The uncontrolled immigration of unskilled EU migrants combined  with the lack of will power from both Labour and Conservative  governments have resulted in British working class being shafted by wage  compression, competition for jobs and community services.  4) Finally the more nuanced one, many remainers I see in London are  part of the decadent, bourgeoisie class who enjoy their tofu, halloumi  and avocado wraps with their nice expensive coffees. When asked why they  want to remain, they mention their desire for a pan-globalist utopia  where everyone gets on with each other in a European Union where they  can go for a jolly to another country. Whoever doesn't subscribe to  their worldview is considered a pleb or racist "little Englander". Well, fuck those people in their rose tinted bubbles. They have never  worked a hard day in their life or grew up on an estate where the  working class of Britain have been forgotten and left to pick up the  pieces from uncontrolled immigration.  Also one last thing from Chairman Corbyn, who today said their can be no control on immigration inside the EU: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36570383
1	BREXIT BREXIT BREXIT!!!! I LOVE IT, greatings from Denmark
0	Oh boy, I cannot wait until we’re back in the EU after 20 years
1	The EU is dangerous It is getting worse and they want an EU Army  You may laugh now, but I hope you dont pay later  The EU needs to go , and go *quickly*…
0	Brexit could very well lead to the end of the UK, or even of Great Britain.
0	It's a shambles.
0	I'm a Remainer, a great admirer of Europe's cultural and intellectual heritage and proud of Britain's illustrious place in that story. I love Europe, its beautiful geography, engrossing historical heritage and the company and friendship of its diverse peoples.  I'm European tonight and I'll be European tomorrow- as are we all. That is a fact.  But a Remainer I may be I am not a Remoaner. Eurosceptics have won a long and difficult battle and for that they get my, ever so slightly grudging, but sincere respect and congratulations.  We need to move forward now as a united country and it's beholden on Leavers more than most to make that work; this is your party.  I'll do my bit and I genuinely hope that it works out.
1	Boris has to show his people that they can be as well off, or better, outside the EU. The EU has to ensure that this is not the case to avoid other states following suit
0	It is the worst thing to happen to UK since WW2
0	From the US to UK bros, those who run our countries are so fucked
1	We have won a peaceful revolution. We have defeated the europhile globalist, protectionist authoritarians and ensured the future of our country for generations to come is one of sovereign democracy. Thankyou fellow Brexiteers , Thankyou Farage, Thankyou Boris. It’s down to you, all heroes.
0	if we left and got Labour we'd quite honestly be totally and completely screwed!!!   That is because in order to make leaving work we have to become a competitive country.
1	It’s the EU that will implode when we leave without a deal and they go bust.
0	A shameful day, the will of a scam by Britain's tax Dodgers
0	I wonder how many Brexiteers will stand up to be counted when things start going wrong, now that they can't blame The EU....? ;)
1	We never voted for UNION in the first place...thats why this is an anti-climax...we voted to be in a common trading market...NOTHING MORE
0	Bad
0	Leaving a large market will do damage to the UK economy
0	I over heard my manager who has 5 kids and earns £8.50 an hour say she is gunna vote boris because she doesnt want to have to pay tax for immigrants, its at that moment i gave up on democracy.
1	Yeah well the majority voted leave years ago so it’s about time democracy kicked into action.
1	I'm voting Leave to escape the United States of Europe, recession be  damned. If the economy was such a sacred cow we'd never go into war or  subsidise unsustainable industry.
0	I plan to ignore the news today, I'm far too upset about leaving the EU. Part of me remains European
0	A sad day today, many have lost a lot and gained nothing.
0	After years of trying to convince idiots that being in the EU is fully, wholly and completely in Britain's interest, I shall be voting to leave the EU. Why? Because people refuse to listen. They're so indoctrinated with the media's version of what the EU is and does they have no need for facts, or the broader realities of the EU. Fine. Let's go. Let's see how leaving the EU squares up to your moronic fantasies. Ignorance has a price. Time to settle the bill.
0	Nationalism is a sickness...Brexit is product of sick ignorant nationalism...
0	Stop dreaming and face the reality: your country will be poorer
0	How long before the next generation seek the vote to return. Will Farage get an EU pension? Finally one Union Jack for sale on ebay
1	The media and Twitterati continue to inflame the situation at every opportunity, while the vast majority of people, both Remainers and Leavers are getting on with their lives.
0	Wtf is 'Brexodus', most cringe thing I've seen since 'Brexit'. please get a grip
1	Borris you got the job done. cheers 🍻
0	Finally. breathes out
0	Just wait.When reality hits and this pipe dream about reigniting the British Empire and restoring it to its former glory evaporates - he and Dom will start blaming EU for that as well.
1	A lot of working class UK citizens are angry that East Europeans are under-cutting their wages and also sending UK English benefit money back home to their families: in fucking East Europe! Can you blame them, really, can you blame them? The homeless in the UK want the money spent on them , not spent building a mansion in Prague for someone who just popped over to the UK. The UK working class want them gone, sooner the better and fuck the middle-class snowflakes [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40061921](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40061921)
1	Can't see it happening. The EU would rather destroy itself than agree a good deal with the UK in case it looks like the UK, ' has got away with it ' to their minds.
0	Great idea guys! How about we all come together and share resources and knowledge, have free and easy trade and travel between countries and the ability to live where we like and all without losing control of our own laws and borders and having a veto on any laws introduced by this organisation? Wait that's what we had? So why have we left? Oh yeh: "brexit means brexit"... Well that's ok then..
1	I'm from Poland and I'm jealous of this decision
1	This is the greatest moment in modern British history.
0	Mate, you gotta think about those poor billionaires. The EU was trying get them to declare and pay taxes on all those millions that they hide on offshore accounts. It’s all sorted it out now.
0	Britain is a tiny island, a pitty island. Brexiters are very naive, they will regret.
1	We rule Britannia again! 🇬🇧
1	Brexit is a mistake for the EU who made poor decisions that ultimately lead to the UK's withdrawl from the EU and it's institutions.  I'm confident that after a bumpy start the UK will do well and be a great success operating outside of the protectionist EU and it's institutions.
1	The EU was a bad idea from day one!!
0	Yesterday was BrexitDay. I sobbed like a baby.
0	BREXSHIT is a ploy to crash the UK economy so the rich can buy up land, properties, business. The rich despose of us when ever they went. All the modern problems in the world are do to the rich
0	I'm so tired. Wouldn't you know it, once again I left it until last minute to write all my Brexit Day cards........most of them contain the phrase "I hope you're f**king happy......tw*t"
0	Unfortunately we have the same here in Germany. Every household here has to pay more than 17,-EUR per month, for our daily dose of anti-conservative, anti-Brexit, anti-Trump and pro-climate scam propaganda.
0	I  feel so ashamed of what we’ve become reading this account from a French person driven away by Brexit. Ashamed of what we’ve become. People who have given years, decades of their lives to this country driven out by a xenophobic ideology and what it’s unleashed.
0	Millions of people can't be wrong... unless they're British.
0	steel works, mines all shut down because of cheap imports, ship yards are starting to close because they can be built cheaper abroad like everything else
1	After years of struggling, UK finally leave the European Union starting from 1 Feb 2020.
0	If you're leaving, just leave. But don't try to drag others along the way
1	Britain belongs to a continent called Europa. This does not mean she must bow to an unelected bureaucracy in Brussels
0	I and many other sensible people will have already maneuvered to ensure my EU citizenship is not stripped from me against my will, by taking advantage of the many loopholes available to claim dual nationality. Have your cake and eat it too!
0	The sad thing is the debate up to the referendum will be dominated by the right wing media and the already very wealthy who have little to lose financially from an exit and simply want fewer immigrants. It'll be the ordinary worker who will suffer big time from this exit.
0	Couldn’t we just use the existing pound coin which will be worth about 50p after Brexit anyway?
0	we remain in the EU, for the transitional period, continuing to follow rules etc, but we have no say whatsoever.   Big player to no player.
0	leave voters are narrow minded and thick
1	Leave Britons, leave! Take back your sovereignty!
0	Voting requires adequate information, a good grasp of the facts and basic common sense.brexit was based on poor and unreliable information, lack of knowledge, denial of facts and the results defied all common sense.
1	Staying in EU is not an option.
0	To be honest, I believe Charles de Gaulle was right, UK doesn’t belong to the continent! But now it would be disastrous to leave EU. For both sides. And let’s not forget, that if UK leaves EU, that would give to Scotland the chance to split out and abandon England and UK would be dismantled.
1	Dont need initiatives as we dont want a deal !
1	leaving the EU would solve our actual problems.
1	This is so exciting! YAY, and congratulation Brits!
1	when please someone tell me When was the last time a British PM spoke like that about the future? Remarkable speech free from complicated language and hyper babble. usual media garbage questions from the usual suspects who just seem unable to get on the bus!!!
0	Brexit is just idiotic. I can't believe the government allowed uneducated people to vote on such an important issue in the first place. Now they'll have to face the consequences and end up being an underdeveloped country in 50 years
1	We all know the EU make the rules and the EU break the rules ..
1	As a diehard Brexiteer I say: leave means leave! Don't let door hit you on way out!
1	Unlike you, I, in my very early 30's, deplored the attempts to join the Common Market and in particular, Mr Heath's lies about no loss of sovereignty when he took us in without consulting us. I seized the opportunity to vote to leave in 1975, but was outvoted. Everything I feared then, over the next 40 years happened, though even I had not foreseen the madness of the common currency. I have to say I did foresee all the other ghastly things that have happened like the corruption and the profligacy, like the ECJ and the toothless parliament. Thank God we are now out.
0	The EU is corrupt and a disgusting gravy train, one since the Kinnochs Labour will never desert. Leaving plays to my sense of justice and honesty but would be silly given the bigger picture.
1	Name one person who has had a bigger impact on European and British politics. A knighthood for the hero Nigel Farage! 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
0	Unfortunately my passport renewal time is here and this #probrexit offering has arrived today  😢  #Brexit #StillEuropean #ScotlandIsOpen #ScotlandLovesEU  🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿   🇪🇺
1	Good job UK. Get out while the getting is good, before the EU collapses in on itself.
0	For me, the most obvious thing that would happen if we came out of Europe (assuming Cameron gets his treaty changes and then holds a referendum,  of which I am doubtful) is that it would almost inevitably mean closer ties to the USA. I don't want that.
0	I am a 24-year-old British-Asian woman from London. I voted remain. I am so deeply saddened by the results I watched come in through the night. It seems I’ve been experiencing the run-up to the election in some sort of bubble on my Facebook page, where it is filled by the people who have similar political leanings. This is what makes it even more shocking.  In the past three weeks I have experienced harassment (physical and verbal) on public transport. Two out of the three have included racial slurs. It is hard to disassociate that from the rhetoric of the leave campaign, which seems to have given a voice to “moderate” racists and xenophobes. It can’t be a coincidence that several of my friends have experienced a similar thing.  I have lived in this country all my life and for the first time feel very ashamed to be British. I am angry that the older generation have selfishly voted for a future that I will have to live with. Young people did not vote for this. I am angry that I have to wake up to Nigel Farage’s smug face claiming that the NHS figures that have been touted were a lie. I am angry that my European friends, as well as my non-white British friends and family members have woken up to a less safe, more divided country.
0	As a spectator on the outside, looking in - and as a US Citizen - I'd argue that the economic costs pale in comparison to the political cost both the UK and the US have suffered as a result of the strong conservative upraise in influence in-both respective nations. We have lost strength of clout and influence on a global scale and neither country is seen as politically stable nor reliable.
0	Very sad indeed. One day we will return EU.!
1	Britain did the right thing getting out of the EU. It's all about taxation without representation. The UK is now free to govern themselves again. Being a member of the dumb EU makes your country's taxes go way up.
1	Rejoice! Tonight we bath in the tears of remoaners. Feels good.
1	they did well ....... europe is a prostitute
1	We voted to Leave. No Customs Union. No adherence to EU laws. Control of our own borders. This is No Deal Brexit.
1	Remainers are, almost exclusively, bourgeois, with very little loyalty to anything but capital and nothing but contempt for the poor and the working classes. If they can be richer and posher under a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, they will favor dictatorship. They have no allegiance to anything but money and themselves. The EU is a dictatorship that helped make them richer, hence they love the EU and hate the UK. More and more people are realizing that bourgeois liberalism, or "neoliberalism," is anti-democracy. Just look at how the bourgeois liberals spent four years trying to undo a democratic vote for Brexit in the UK and a vote for a president they don't like in the US. Point this out and they pull out their favorite canard: the "Russian hackers." As if a few Facebook ads were all it took for the people their policies have ruined to turn against them.
0	Sad day. #brexit
1	I suppose it sets a bad example as now other nations may leave which would weaken the EU.  Then again UK never used the Euro and seems to go there own way regarding electrical outlets and which side of the road to drive on.  Due to this nonconformity I suppose if any nation would leave it would be the one with the independent streak
0	So is this the end.....?
0	Boris must knows that we can't have the Butter and the money of the Butter...French proverb. And the EU it's not ONLY a market.
1	Stop their inflated benefits which was a law from the EU! Once we are out, they should get less than the British People. It is disgusting what they get while we have worked and paid our taxes and for what? A bloody pittance!!!
0	There is no question in my mind that a 'Brexit' would deal a significant blow to the E.U.'s strength and resilience at exactly the moment when the West is under attack from multiple directions.
0	I'm rooting for a no deal brexit because I believe that uninformed, stupid voting must be punished.
0	A hard brexit will be apocalyptic for the uk. Hopefully they can figure out a trade deal in the next few seconds before the official exit.
0	cancel brexit or suffer the consequences
1	Yeah own free will
1	Well done I like him. No messing Boris we want a clean break not any more extensions or being tied to the EU. You need to keep your promises if you want to be elected next time 💕
0	There should be an independent legal inquiry regarding the highjack of Brexit by this government. This isn’t democracy it’s a subversion of democratic law. At what point did Mrs May change her mind after she stood there and addressed the nation on live tv and said Brexit means Brexit no deal? Has she been blackmailed and influenced by £££, (foreign) or domestic subjects unknown? Blackmailing, influencing or bribing a sitting prime minister or accepting or giving political favours at a later date surely must be illegal? Somewhere along the way her whole attitude and her narrative to a no deal changed. The question has to be asked in parliament.
0	One benefit of brexit is that lots of manufacturing workers are going to have a LOT more freetime. Around 100% more.....
0	Oh goody. Another day facing the consequences of the result of a vote on the all-too-real future having been dictated by nostalgia for a non-existent past.
0	I’m not a UK citizen but I really can’t see any way this is a net benefit.
1	Remainers are still going through the stages of grief, and I take no pleasure in seeing them writhe, however much they schemed to thwart the democratic will of the British people. The reality is, the UK is leaving the anti-democratic, hyper-regulated embrace of the Continent, and Britain is choosing its own path, subject to continuing democratic oversight. You don't like it? Don't play games with technicalities and misrepresent your opponents. Win the next election. Everyone will respect that result.
0	The cowards did it on a weekend to avoid a drop in the value of the pound.
0	Except that it's not one size fits all. That size didn't fit the UK, which wasn't part of the single currency, or Schengen. There are various models out there, from all-in (Eurozone and Schengen), the UK model (as was), or membership of the SM/CU but not the EU itself. The EU isn't a political power grab. It's the opposite. It allows me (for the time being at least) to up and leave any country in Europe whose politicians I don't like, and go and live in another one, no questions asked. It's amazing. Fair enough there's a big bureaucracy and some continent-wide rules to follow, but thse laws are just a substitute for national laws which would exist in their place. The nation state is an outdated concept.
1	We won Mr. Stark.
0	Do I support Brexit? No.
1	Enjoy your independent nation. Your the first but not the last.  The eu must end or become democratic. The european people are tired of this. The people at the top of the eu are unelected and unaccountable.
0	This may come as a complete surprise to many #Brexit supporters, but the EU trade negotiator Michel Barnier will be looking after the interests of the 27 countries that are members of the EU. Strangely, there is no requirement for him to look after the interests of a non-member!
1	Well this is a surprise. I thought itv were better than this. Brexit is about improving life
1	You can see these bitter old Remainers hate the UK ,wetting themselves to see the UK fail ,The Remainer slaves can always jump ship to their EU Masters
1	No more concessions to the EU. Let's take back control.
0	DOWN WITH BREXIT, BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH, LONG LIVE THE EU,
1	This is exactly what the EU dictators were afraid of. If England is successful with its Brexit, that could open the floodgates for others to follow. The EU is becoming an unwanted organization, that will soon dissolve in the dust bins of history...good riddance.
0	We might is well stay in it now bored of hearing about now same old story blah blah blah
1	Awesome! Definitely a historic moment. But they could only give this 26 seconds?!! Aren't most TV commercials longer than this?
0	Enjoy traveling to and fro! What a bunch of morons.
0	Brexit is a misguided attempt to turn back the clock to better times. Politicians are just parasites that will go in whatever direction offers them best benefits.
0	Brexit is stupid idea ..waste of time .until now no one give a clear idea what is going on .
0	my assessment is Brexit is unlikely to deliver any economic gains
1	A BIG congratulations to my brothers and sisters in GB. One step to a better nation. It may be rocky in the start but this is definitely a greater good.
0	Britain bids TATA good bye to Europe Hopefully the old empire is there to save the situation with lots of trade, beer and cricket (I was just reading up about how one far-sighted British overlord back in the day had opined that ‘Scotland is more like Spain than Bengal is like the Punjab’ ) Best wishes from the sub-continent and hopefully things will not be as bad as presumed
1	Good man, keep going, don't let the people of questionable parentage let you down.
0	Did you enjoy eating shhittt on Brexit day as you celebrated your gullibility!
1	We are Great Britain, so that’s what we’ll be, yesterday, today and tomorrow. Let’s start believing
1	Wonderful news.   Now scrap the BBC licence and fix London.
0	Out of the E.U. and into the unknown.Doom and gloom in Britain from here on in.
1	Why would you want to live under someone else's laws I say good riddance
0	I’m a 20-year-old student in Scotland. Although originally from London I’ve lived most of my life in France, where my parents moved when I was young. I consider myself European rather than British or English or Scottish.  I strongly supported the Better Together side in the Scottish independence referendum, but today I would rather live in an independent, but European Scotland, than a UK broken off from Europe.  In the immediate few weeks, I intend to make good on my pledge to myself to claim German nationality to retain European citizenship, as I am eligible for it as a descendant of refugees of Nazism to Britain. I’m shocked that my grandparents, refugees themselves, voted leave to curb immigration.
1	Good to see Bruxelles sharpening their pencils. Time to cut Britain out of Europe.
1	HAPPY INDEPENDENCE DAY BRITAIN!
1	Brexit is bigger than the Conservative Party. Brexit is bigger than all the British political parties put together so Britain has to do whatever it takes to get a proper Brexit (Hard Brexit).
1	I am so happy we left
0	True stories: Leaver told me that he voted Brexit because he wanted his South African x-wife out of the country. Another one because she hated her Egyptian x-husband. ... and an EU national voted leave because her husband is Caribbean .. when I said what that means she said loudly "I told you my husband is Caribbean !!" .. go figure. Bottom line NONE of the above mentioned people have any clue or idea of what they voted for.
1	we're more than a star on someone else's flag
1	BBC spreading fear even now. Bye, bye EU, and hopefully soon, bye, bye BBC.
1	Most obvious and concise reason to avoid the EU: They want morally bankrupt Turkey to join.
1	when the one nuclear power that was blocking military integration is gone, we will be able to start seriously discussing a European military
1	Why arent there fireworks being sold to mark the moment when we leave the port that is the EU and finally set sail
0	The way we digest our news is changing. Trump goes straight to Twitter, Boris gave his #Brexit speech via Facebook and the established MSM journos aren't happy. Party's over guys, it was fun for you whilst it lasted.
0	Boris Johnson going to break up the United Kingdom
0	So what’s whole point of leaving the EU if they have a lot of negotiation to do.
0	I shouldn’t laugh at our own misfortune, it will do neither myself or my own any good. I am so angry
0	Brexit makes me sad, anxious, regretful and angry. But it can’t stop me being European to my core. Like my fellow Scots, I refuse to succumb to isolationism. #LeaveALightOnForScotland
0	Just wait until Trump f**ks us up massively. Then their plastic Union flags won't do them much good
1	I mean people are allowed to choose sovereignty over a stronger economy, the economy is not the be all end all of life.  I think there were just too many cultural clashes with the European and British identities that frayed the relationship over time.  All we can aim for now is to rebuild as amicable relationship as possible after years of political contempt from both sides.
1	What a feeling - woken up to no longer having to follow those pesky EU laws! FREEDOOOOOOOM
1	the way he's talking he could be one of the best PM we have ever had.
1	Why you make such a sweeping statement? Of course ‘leavers’ understand we’re close geographically (and economically) to Europe. Europe (in its widest interpretation) is not a stable and secure place. To be successful we need to be positive to all challenges, Brexit and others.
0	It’s so weird to see that people are celebrating their mistake.
1	Great news! There will be some good some bad but the independence and self-determination is worth it!!!!
0	Who the English will trade products now Americans takes from China for 1dollar each how British worker will compete with Chinese workers
0	Hahaha good luck standing alone against US, China and India. Everyone for himself and God for us all works every time ;)
0	So disappointed with how my country has conducted itself through all of this, and with Brexit in general. From togetherness, multiculturalism and inclusion to segregation, xenophobia and patriotism. Bye EU, I hope to see more of Europe someday.
0	now that uk is the enemy we should destroy there economy.
0	Honestly it seems like the Russians got exactly what they wanted. The UK has spent years only focusing on this one stupid issue. And it literally might end the UK entirely with Scotland and Wales and NI wanting to stay in the EU. To me I just think at some point, the Prime Minister should just say “fuck it” and throw the whole idea out. Call it quits and just stay in the EU.
0	Border Protest as Brexit Begins: Brexit does not have the support of the people in Ireland.
1	How to make your nation FREE!?... STEP ONE : Lead the Example of the Brexit!!
0	Dear Britain. Tonight, you will get what you've so longed for. We say goodbye and good luck on your false path.
0	My initial position, prior to 2016, was that of a Remainer.
1	The unelected eu, overturning refererenda until the British said NO!.
1	Everyone is concerned about economy and probable consequences, while the principle that people is sovereign becomes a second option. This is how democracy is watered down till becomes worthless.
1	“we have made our choice”
1	The middle class liberals voted Remain because they are self loathing of thier own country and the working class voted Leave because they are proud of their country.
0	I hope the option of no brexit is still possible
0	After 47 yrs the Leavelings got what they wanted, albeit by respecting a vote achieved by cheating & breaking the law. They were aided by a weak & ineffective opposition. Now they must respect my democratic right to campaign to rejoin. Unfinished business
1	the best thing that our country has done yet
1	I'm surprised the sky hasn't fallen in this morning followed by flooding , pestilence and plague , perhaps brexit won't be that bad after all .
1	I am sure the EU is just trying to scare----they don't scare me. We were fine before we went into the EU years ago, we would be fine whatever we did.......we have everything going for us
0	I feel the US and UK are mirroring each other. Bad choices. Bad policy. Bad actors.
0	Scotland is coming back to the EU. We are not staying in the uk . Scotland love s you EUROPÉ
0	What is this? What deal? They still need to discuss all the big things like trade,  citizenship and visas, security, etc....
1	I'm french and happy for Great Britain. I hope that there will be a Frexit one day.
0	It comforts me to know that however bad a day I have tomorrow, at least I’m not Boris Johnson.
1	We live in a period where buying British has gone , but now we are independent it gives us hope . Hope that British businesses will once again be successful and steadfast
1	Its sad and a little scary that the British people, who democratically voted to leave the EU, are being held hostage by an incompetent/corrupt Parliament and EU.
1	Our liberty bell is ringing for Britain tonight
0	Stupit Brexiteers wants to have a Brexit, so they have to deal with the consequences. You can’t have both.
1	I just love the genuine hurt and salt from continentals. It's hilarious how naive you all are about this. All you people have done is make the same tired arguments, same crappy jokes about the delay, without realising your superstate government literally caused it. When Donald Tusk stood down he admitted to doing everything in his power to stop Brexit, and left a message for all the remoaners telling them to "never give up". What does that say? The EU love meddling with our democracy. They really really REALLY had the upper hand when our government had no majority. We had one of the weakest and most incompetent conservative leaders as well, Boris did what she couldn't in 3 years. It's hilarious how blind you truly are. You think we're going to crash and burn because of Brexit. Because we'll be leaving an undemocratic political hub. You think our economy is going to crash but why would it? We spend more of our GDP than we get out, not only that, but we're one of the five global powers. What reason does our economy have to suffer? Oh, and "most of our trade comes from the EU", wow really??? I never knew that, I truly wonder why we voted to leave. All you faggots have done is point and laugh at us in the process, talking about this like it's a comedy series, making naive remarks about more delay, now look. We've actually left. It's like what Nigel Farage said "you all laughed at me at the beginning, but in 2016 you stopped." Of course the scaremongering won't stop though. You'll still carry on fretting about our economy crashing for X reason, Y goods being of poor quality. Or our 300 year old union breaking up. Well keep telling yourself that. I will enjoy licking the salty tears of continentals that make the same tired arguments now that we're leaving. Or better yet the doublely braindead TLDR viewer base.
1	Tonight we have left the EU and will start a bright new chapter in the UK's history
1	Congrats to the UK. You get to be a sovereign country again.
1	Look at the remainers Crying lol they need to get a life
1	There will be no EU Dictatorship in the future watch we are number 1 domino. Thank you to everyone who has put the Great back into Britain.
0	Welsh farmers are now bleating about losing EU farming subsidies and there will be tariffs on their lamb etc.Yet these very same farmers voted to leave the EU. They will soon regret that choice.Much more worrying is the loss of most of our car manufacturing-Airbus,chunks of finance,big sections of Pharmaceutical
1	EU bureaucrats still don't get it, they respond to national sentiment with empty singing and catchphrases. More countries will leave and that will be better for Europe.
1	My eyes getting misty here. England you've fought so hard to take back your sovereignty from European Union. Some of you lost some friends or family members because of your support for Brexit, you want freedom in your OWN terms not dictated by EU. My brothers and sisters across the pond, England is worth fighting for. You are now in-charge of your own country, you are the one who will determine the future of England, country of the British people. I wish all of you the best, God bless you. LONG LIVE GREAT BRITAIN!! Wave UNION JACK with PRIDE!
1	Happy Independence Day, ironically enough, from your American friends.
0	give that EU vacant seat from post-england to Ukraine who much deserves it! 🇺🇦
1	As any good student of #Geopolitics knows, words matter - and they matter because they are moulded, managed
0	Poor, poor Britain. Choosing, all on your own, the destruction of your way of life.
1	Everytime any of the EU leaders open their mouths. It just shows what a nasty bunch of power mad people they are.  Desperate because they have been found out by people in the UK who wont stand for their elitism and want their soveriegnty back.   They dont like the fact that they managed to convince other EU countries to change their minds on votes over things like the Euro and policy issues. Yet with the UK after nearly four years we have still stood firm.
1	CELEBRATE!
1	Here’s a thought, why don’t all the remainers stop whining, and go live the EU paradise they adore and stop being so nasty and petty to the good democratic folk of the UK
1	There are many dangers Britain may yet face, but it will be all the better for facing them as a free, independent, and self-governing nation.
0	Yes it has pointed out how stupid Brexit is to everyone, thanks Britain
0	11 months? Good luck with that! We all know how it's going to end. It takes time to pass any form of legislation, governments are bureaucratic in nature after all.
0	Any #Remainer out there,  don't give Johnson the satisfaction of TV ratings. Don't watch, Turn the TV off, who wants to listen to a snivelling, lying cheat.There is nothing to celebrate in my opinion.
0	America is Rejoicing for the UK! Congratulations!
0	Nothing will come from brexit, apart from job losses, its all bs
0	Old stubborn UK people destroying the future for their next generations.
1	Make England great again.
1	If the UK doesn't go through with Brexit, the whole voting process will be 100% delegitimized. Why vote when the vote is not upheld. The government will be exposed as a complete sham.
1	Bexit problem made by "" uk"""...
0	I've voting remain. Yes europe is a clusterfuck but the problems it has can  be solved, and the problems we will get if we leave will not be. I have  real issues with Brussels, but the good outweighs the bad.  Also i hate this whole fucking immigration scare tactic. Even if i  was super anti-immigration, the whole syrian refugee flood is a bullshit  scare tactic. Do people forget we have the channel anyway? Also we  guard the french side of the border in a special deal we have with them.  We could lose that anyway. I wouldn't be surprised if immigration  become WORSE by leaving. And if you worry about EU immigration? Well i  guess the 2 million+ UK citizens leaving in spain and france better head  home then.
1	Would be cheaper to attract people in uk with apprenticeships and training.
1	Good job UK. EU will never taste our delicious nickel
1	the EU, my government have ignored its own citizens for decades since joining. They have become fat and lazy because the EU makes most of the rules now
0	Brexit is a very stupid thing on Britains part. Its opened up a can of worms with Scotland & Ireland leaving the UK. The economic effects & costs will be horrendous. Privatized health care, shortages, financial collapse & lord knows what else.
0	What a waste of UK time money and energy Brexit is
0	I envy you so much.....waiting for DANEXIT
0	Bretards won't believe anything.
0	BREXIT will be disastrous. Why cannot others see this fact. There is no going back to the good old days when England was a Great Nation, no matter what all the leavers think, wish, dream etc. England is not a major world power or player. Good luck on trying to stand alone.
0	I understood the message from Boris! We Europeans are undesirable as long as we don't give UK power and money!
1	Lead Brexit, follow those leading Brexit, or get out of Britain. Be part of the solution to put the “great” back into Britain or get out of Britain.
1	Who CARES about the world economy.  Each nation needs to worry about their own.  GB's economy would be much better if they left the EU because then THEY could make their own decisions about the direction they need to go in trade and such.  Not to mention, when you are paying for millions of people to come to your nation and live without working or doing anything that would better the nation and people, your economy will always be bad.  Where does the money come from to pay for all of these "Refugees"?  Lots of different organizations and programs but they all come down to the original spot, the taxpayers that work and pay taxes.  Great Britain needs to bail on the EU before they themselves are eating up by it.  Several nations in Europe are essentially gone, look at France, Germany, Brussels and others.  GB isn't far behind and will meet the same fate if they don't rid themselves of the EU, close their borders tight and start kicking out "refugees" and other troublesome Muslims that have no intention of assimilating into GB but want to make it theirs with Sharia.  In America we need to clamp down on our border, kick out ALL illegal immigrants, STOP bringing in Refugees and start sending some of them back.  We are almost $20 TRILLION in debt thanks to Obama and the Liberal disease.  We cannot afford to just give away more money to people that want to come here, not work, not assimilate into America, but essentially take it over with their culture and so called religion.
1	And make no mistake, it was all down to Farage, even Boris getting a majority was down to him, so thanks Mr Farage, a job well done.
0	Until last week, we were full members. We are still in transition.   You chose vassalage, supposedly well aware of what that would entail, and now you’re complaining!   Brexilogic.
0	Let me put it this way: If somebody says ‘I want to leave your house, but I’ll take the key and I will come back whenever I like and take whatever I like from that house.”, that doesn’t work,”   Seems clear to me, but that’s what UK wants and EU says no go!
0	They're going to regret it.
0	Chairman and CEO Carlos Ghosn said: “We are a global business with a strong presence in Europe.  “We have a rich heritage in the UK, with 30 years of manufacturing . . . Last year we produced more than 475,000 vehicles in the UK – 80 per cent of which are exported.  “Our preference as a business is, of course, that the UK stays within Europe - it makes the most sense for jobs, trade and costs. For us, a position of stability is more positive than a collection of unknowns.  “We obviously want the Nissan UK plant and engineering centre to remain as competitive as possible when compared with other global entities, and each future investment opportunity will be taken on a case by case basis, just as it is now.”
0	Vote Remain For all our sakes.
0	Are the Brexit muppets even aware that when they talk about their country being the fifth largest economy in the world they are stating they are from India.
0	The EU was never meant to enslave the UK. Its goal was to prevent Europeans from fighting amongst one another, by stimulating internal trade. And it succeeded in that: it brought us prosperity and far less wars. Now the UK is gambling with both of these things, and there is a good chance that we will all find ourselves in the old, dangerous situation again. Are you guys happy now?
0	People should be interested in politics. Good politicians can change our lives for the better. Bad politicians can ruin everything. And currently, that's what they're doing. Don't let them get away with it. Fight back!
0	Dear EU, give us a shout when we can come back
1	"Notions about British tolerance, English diffidence, decency and pragmatism, painted a picture of exceptionalism.
0	When they negotiate actual trade deals then they’ll feel the impact of Brexit.  Who will be in a position of strength?  Not England.
0	The EU will sink Johmson as theyy hold ALL the cards...Johnson holds Nothing EXCEPT the WTO threat and the threat of commiting suicide by crashing over the cliff. BREXITEERS.... WHAT IS THE POINT OF BREXIT?
0	The closest thing that the EU has as a goal to "scrapping nations" is scrapping roaming fees.
0	Did not know people can be that dumb
1	The EU interpretation of a "level playing field" is for the UK to do what they tell us to do.
1	In the words of my lovely grandmother, as she voted Brexit on her postal vote, "It's not about my future, it's about yours"
0	Please please #VoteRemain tomorrow my fellow Brits! Xxx
1	We got out just in time
1	We look forward to doing business with a FREE and INDEPENDENT Britain
1	I'm a firm supporter of Brexit, but I'll only believe it when we leave behind all EU laws, we keep our hard earned taxes and we get our waters back.Until then, this is all smoke and mirrors...
1	Goodbye EU....and we don't mind closing the door behind us...
1	I'm filled with renewed confidence that Brexit will be a roaring success
0	Think the U.K. going break up shame took few bigots to ruin a nation shame but hey that’s what those Brexiters deserve if that happens.
1	We must have a deal that inflicts maximum damage to the EU.........Lets make them suffer!
0	Let's see how many people still think Brexit was a good idea five years from now. I hope I'm wrong, but I think a lot of people that voted Leave will realise it was a huge mistake.  Still waiting for the report on Russian interference btw...
0	I now strongly support and will democratically fight for a re-entry to the EU, even without all the special arrangements, which the UK enjoyed
0	Loved the interviews where people couldn't explain what we are able to  do now we have left EU. They kept going on about "We have our freedom  back" etc. when everyone's daily lives are going to be the same. I don't  think anyone felt opressed by the EU until the idea of Brexit was  pushed on everyone. It's all so silly. I don't think anyone cared much  about the UK's relationship with the EU until it was questioned at the  start of all this.
0	England  - a profoundly Eurosceptic place - is going its own way. Good luck with that.
0	The UK can no long influence internal EU politics, nor can it influence EU-US relations. The direction of these two dynamics which have been vital for the UK maintaining its influence is now completely out of its control.
0	Congratulations from Belgium, you made the right choice.
0	as crazy as it sounds i think british still haven't anderstood anything to the brexit.
1	I'm a reluctant for. If we remain in the EU, it will not reform, the reason for this is simple, it's too big to reform. Any reforms take years to actually get to the EU parliament and even then they may not pass. If we vote to leave, it will empower all the other anti-EU or reform EU parties and then finally, the EU will have to listen or lose the entire European project.
1	Cheers from the States
0	I just curious to know how uk will thrive economically after this doesnt seem possible
0	So that's it; it's all over. I'm now no longer a citizen of the EU; I'm now just a resident of a small isolated island in the middle of the sea and I couldn't be more sad
0	The European Union’s benefits outweigh its drawbacks
1	We joined it under the guise of it being a trading bloc and that's categorically not what it is now
0	the Brits will believe anything as long as it's on the side of a double decker bus
1	The UK "might" end up worse off financially in 20 years than if we stayed in the EU
1	European its just good on the paper and when they speak but action are far away of that :) like Farage say : We love europe, we just hate the european union ! <3
0	You would think that a Government desperate to keep the UK together would be trying to increase its contact with the Scotland
1	Lots of negative remoaners around this morning. Stay positive, don’t rise to their bait. Brexit!!! , we’ve done it!
0	I voted against brexit and haven't changed my views. I also to take into account that 17 million people voted for brexit. Changing the decision of a mojority of voters now would most likely only make matters among the British population, which is already in a bad way. Safe to say, no matter what happens, its going to be one hell of a shit show.
1	Stop so many migrants coming in
1	As you might expect from the Guardian, much of these so-called facts in this study are way out of line and highly tendentious. Even BBC's Newsnight recently reported studies showing that the UK could grow at up to 8% per year if out of the EU. Not a word of it here.
1	Now it’s time to bring back manufacturing to Great Britain, instead of outsourcing to the EU.
1	Proceed with BREXIT as the voters want. The fragile EU will have no choice other than renegotiate trade with a U.K.
0	My worst nightmare has happened, as a country we voted out
1	For tonight the U.K. is building up its flood defences to cope with the amount of remain saltiness flowing at 11pm.   Happy Brexit Day🇬🇧
0	The amount of leave voters who really don't know what they voted for is astonishing. Here's me actively hoping I can eat my words in the coming years
1	I feel bad for Scotland. They should be allowed to separate from the UK. It doesn't make sense. An article said Scotland can't be separated, because they share land on the island. Ok, but what does that have to do with it? If you look at any large body of land (Europe for example), they all share the large body of land, but it is separated by country.
0	Brexit really reminds me of the story about Congo's independence. They all cheered because they would be free.
1	What a Pity.
1	The trade deal they can get with the United States will benefit the UK BIGGLEY!!! Well done Brits!!! And congratulations.
1	Being tied to the same organisation that created the Euro crisis, the migrant crisis, the banking crisis, the mass unemployment crisis & the democratic deficit crisis would be the hight of stupidity.
0	A bare bones trade agreement that just eliminates tariffs could be costly for manufacturing to live with given how tightly entwined manufacturing value chains are across the UK and the EU
0	Stay with the EU for the love of god. So much bad will come from leaving.
1	No second thoughts here!!!!!!! Fantastic day for great Britain
1	Nice. Time to make Northern Ireland part of Ireland.
1	1. Brexit finally happened—We're out of there! Finally. 2. I understand some moron was stopped from trying to steal Magna Carta 3. The US Senate just voted NOT to include extra witnesses against TrumpSo far, 2020 shaping up quite nicely.I would like to now see: The BBC brought to heel Trump re-elected … feel free to add to the list!
0	The collapsing UK economy is hardly surprising given that the UK is soon to cut itself off from one of the world’s biggest markets, the EU. The only solution is to dredge Ramsgate harbour even deeper.
1	Leave, there is a little benefit to staying in and Brussels has shown they don't give a fuck about compromises. Only sensible option if you actually want to help our country
0	Experts are worried. That's all I need to know.
1	We saved Europe in two wars, we were the British empire, we are quite capable of going it alone. We still have the commonwealth and the rest of the world to trade with. No deal immediately and then start negotiating a deal. Cut of the fish today and they will agree a deal tomorrow.
0	Welcome Scotland
0	still waiting for Lord King to list 2 quantified benefits of leaving the EU
0	One opportunity for Britain to leave on a professional and responsible note and it was tossed away for someone's inflated ego and for him to remain relevant. Absolutely disgraceful and highlights the less 'graceful' elements of the tragedy that is Brexit.
1	Great stuff .we are out
0	more old white guys with an agenda. The UK is screwed, if you think it's bad now, you have no clue. It's about to get far worse. Next time Scotland has the chance it will go independent and go back to the EU
0	Scottish independence surveys 'show Brexit has put union at risk'
1	Don’t trust the FAKE news! Trump has been saying this for years!!! Brexit is a GOOD thing!!!
0	If folks would stop marrying their cousins perhaps things like Brexit would not happen in Britain and elsewhere.  Now that they have thought about it a little bit, why not hold a special vote asking if everyone is sure they want to exit the EU?
0	Britain flexed it's muscles. Yeah. It's elderly atrophic, fat cell damaged weak Brexit muscle. Much like most of its Brexit voters really!
0	so scotland wants to be independent and then join the EU
1	Its astonishing that some people still having allegiance with EU. For God sake stand up for your own nation once.
1	Make UK.  Great again.
1	Over the top bully tactics from the despicable EU. Designed to make things as difficult as it can for the UK. I only wish our government had the guts to do the same in return.
1	We have won the war.  We have now entered the post-strife peace negotiations.
1	Congrats to the 🇬🇧
0	I avoided the news and watched comedy on the television; although I couldn’t laugh, it reminded me that there is intelligence and good humour in the world.
1	I think the sooner we are out of the EU the better.
0	Why Brussels' useful idiot Leo Varadkar is staring down the barrel of defeat in Irish election Failure to fix Ireland's
0	So much for the new world order. God save the Queen! Pip pip and a cheerio!
0	A very sad moment. But it was good to see that the removal of the Union Flag from the line up of all of the nations who make up the EU was done with dignity. If only Nigel Farage and his fellow Brexit MEPs hadn’t behaved in such a crass and arrogant manner and made an equivalent dignified exit from the chamber on Thursday? All he did was to bring shame on our beloved country and show what a narcissistic twerp he is.
0	So stupid to vote Brexit We need those migrants in our hospitals and other places. Those migrants helped out economy as well and now we have to let them go and people will charge much more for doing regular jobs.
1	I still want out!
1	Here's my list of the things I'll miss about being in the EU;......…..................
0	Brexit is the dumbest piece of work handed in by a Government in my lifetime. It doesn't even merit a D-. We shall become more right wing, scraping by with the aid (or raid) of Trump. A grubby little Island floating about on it's lonesome.
0	And life gets that little bit worse. Does it ever get a little bit better? I’m struggling to remember but no, not under a Conservative government it seems.
1	Make Britain Great Again !  Congratulations in leaving the EU
0	And they announce 5% cuts for the north while before the election promised no cuts. Welcome to the "new era".
1	Woke up to a bright new dawn. Sun is shining, UK had left the socialist EU experiment.
0	blaming the fact that many people don't trust the EU on a disconnect, lack of transparency and lack of knowledge about how the EU works
1	Finally, all countries should leave the EU
1	Finally... the Brits have reclaimed their independence, their sovereignty and security from despotic bullies in Brussels.
0	Enjoy your treason day.... sorry I meant Brexit day..
1	Not complaining so much as EU stance proving exactly the point why they voted Leave.
0	Aha we have discovered, The Brexiteers see the world Upside-Down, a form of yoga
0	And the benefits will be...?
1	they forgot that people see how the rest of the world is doing outside of the eu and the true brits wanted to be part of that not bogged down in an eu system that is undemocratic corrupt and seen to be failing
0	Am in England for #Brexit I genuinely hope people who voted for it DO NOT Suffer lack of medical resources Lose their jobs Lose their fishing rights Lose their families I hope it’s everything they wanted & hoped for because it’s going to be difficult and I wish you all well
0	Boris Johnson sabotaged Theresa May because he wanted her job, and the only way to get it was to push for a total madman's Brexit
1	If we just stayed none of this bs would have happened
1	Let’s unleash the potential of the UK
0	I will be fine. Just not as rich as I might have been. Enjoy unemployment, losing your house, poverty, misery, and depression, you mugs.
1	Well done to all those who have been brave and voted out today, here's praying that common sense prevails!
1	As we leave the E.U., the U.K. can turn its back on the austerity policies that have been the hallmark of the euro area.
0	People who support brexit are fucking morons
0	It's a typical case of not knowing what they had until it's gone :( sad situation and sad future to look forward to. It will take so much time to recover from this.....
0	Dear british, I have the impression that your politicians have totaly lost their minds. Putting the economy of a whole country on the line because of some stupid political BS is treason - or isn't it?
1	The EU destroyed Britain's fishing industry, and now is the time and opportunity to rebuild it. We had one of the largest fishing fleets in the world before joining the repressive and restrictive EU.
1	Heaven forbid the UK sets its own laws
0	Goes on march to show just how WOKE and PROGRESSIVE you are to your friends and family.  Throws rubbish in the street for someone else to clean-up. Imagine my shock.
1	Awesome. The McGuiness witch is a rude ass. I would want to leave too. ðŸ’¯ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ˜Ž
1	I'm Dutch but I'm jealous of the UK being separated of the EU.
0	I don’t know if it’s the whole Brexit happening today thing, or the fact I’m stressed and sleep deprived or what... but the vibes today...... disgusting
1	Working class Brits telling the elites to F Off. What a great day!
1	more distractions - Brexit is under way - the more important threat in the UK is the muslim invasion on the street and in the classroom.
0	Brexit sucks
1	We don’t want more European integration and that’s exactly the course the EU is hell bent upon. Indeed it has to integrate further to protect the Euro and we didn’t want to join the Euro
1	That's absurd. You don't have to belong to the EU to have freedom of movement. There are these things called passports that work very well for Americans who travel across the globe.
0	Our politicians, are 100% guilty of making the mess we are in, no-one else.
1	EU IS NOT DEMOCRATIC ! Its a DIKTATURE !
0	Actually Macron (you reference France) won power on the promise of change. Reactionary forces are causing havoc now because they oppose change. Brexit will not bring about positive change: stay tuned. It's a reactionary ploy that will only benefit the super rich.
0	No deal asap !!
0	We were Global Britain. Then  @conservatives  turned into UKIP.   Now we're a Global Laughing Stock.  From our friends in the US: "The problem with holding out for a perfect Brexit plan is that you can’t fix stupid."  #BrexitShambles
1	We will now have true democracy once again
1	Excellent result! Boris looks like he's going for a proper Brexit as opposed to Theresa May's fudge that was like some kind of French farce or Leonardo Vinci opera. I shall be having a drink tonight to celebrate our victory.
1	Brexit is the best thing to happen for UK
0	You can see a bit of sadness on his face. He certainly voted to remain
0	Brexit will be good for Britain, as a geographical construct, it'll be a lovely, empty national park when everybody has buggered off to the continent in search of work, assuming they're not stranded permanently on this festering island.
0	Scotland leaves to join the EU
0	Uk will fall again
1	The UK has regained her liberty, freedom, & Autonomy. Now she can represent her own citizens interests!!!!
0	I didn't believe this would actually happen.
0	Why the victory music
1	You obviously underestimate the resolve of the people of Great Britain and especially, their spirit.
1	The EU is NOT a democracy. the EU parliament has no parliamentary roles. It is a fake. Unelected people run this state, and obviously do not represent the people of this area. The UK may be only the beginning of either a complete reform of the EU or its deconstruction.
1	The EUrines will continue to weep, threaten and sweat incessantly. Nothing new. Brexit will progress until fully completed. Thank goodness. Out means out and so be it.
1	That's fake news about the British searching what's the Eu we all know what it is and over half of us hate it
0	It is a sad day for the UK
1	Come on Boris..I have faith
0	The government wont have anyone to blame for their fuckups anymore
0	t will mean having to go through customs, like before. New trade agreements, new taxes, new limitations. New security. And a lot more costs to do so.
1	Up n at em!! Wonderful morning here, lovely bath this morning, soaked in those left wing remainer tears! #NeverCorbyn #BackBoris #ProBrexit #goodbyecultofcorbyn
1	Congratulations my British brothers and sisters! You are FREE once again!
1	It's time for everyone to be independent. This was supposed to happen last year. Get ready fot the market to crash. The world is going to make a major change in a few years.
1	Hope it works out for the UK. Don't get why all the other people from the EU here are so bitter. Best of luck to you guys!
0	The US and EU will steer the global economy and the UK can only watch on.
0	if you travel to Spain, Italy, Holland, France you'll be amazed of their agriculture power. UK sliced it's throat
0	Great Britain is now Little Lonely Britain.
0	I really hope they go downhill now
0	What next? Little britain gets littler, angrier & poorer, that's what
1	How anyone could be opposed to national sovereignty I really don't know.
1	We are 100% better off outside the EU.  I am sure Boris will get the best deal he can, but we can help ourselves by buying British and supporting our own farmers and producers.
1	There is no guarantee that the trend will continue but what we do need to understand is that it is being driven by Brexit
0	"Nationalism is an infantile disease, it is the measles of mankind." Albert Einstein in 1929 and truer today than it will ever be.
1	450 jobs being cut is only the beginning bbc. At least there'll be so much more diversity in the queues at the job centers :)
1	Never should have. Joined. all that money wasted over the decades for little return and lose control of our identity.
0	If this whole brexit BS has made me realise one thing, it's that I feel more European than British. This country and its 'leaders' are shameful.
1	t was a close run thing, no thanks to the Scots who now should leave the Union if they love the EU so dearly, As for Wales, shoulder to shoulder we stood on the day - Victory is ours!
1	Great job UK. Globalism is a failed idea. The world is safe when all nations are strong prosperous and self dependent
0	My first response was panic. I’m a recent graduate, already facing financial instability, uncertainty in the job market, trying to work out my future. A leave result means more anxiety for me, more instability to navigate and try to understand.  I’m also a woman of colour. From a young age, I’ve been aware of racist and nationalist attitudes in Britain, spread around the country outside of my home and haven of London. I’ve spent years watching people argue to dismantle the systems that allowed my mother and closest friends into the country to work, to lead better, productive lives. I’ve seen people screaming that my immigrant family (biological and chosen) are worthless, that they contribute nothing. And I’ve always felt unwanted, uncomfortable, underrepresented.  This result confirms my fears. That my families aren’t seen as people, as human. They’re numbers, they’re a swarm, a threat. They’re not welcome here, and as a product of immigration, neither am I. With this result, England clings on to its colonial history, and I’m ashamed.
0	Sad times. 2020 is a bad year.
0	They all acting like we was gonna float off into space!
0	#Leave wanted this image everywhere in 2016. Let’s give them what they want. #Remain have not forgotten the #Brexit lies and I hope every one of the 48% that didn’t want this is ready to fight and call these political criminals out on every. lie. they. told. #NotMyBrexit
1	The great Brexit watershed was the 2019 general election. An 80 seat majority changed everything,
1	god bless nigel farage and the british nation.
1	We did not vote for a deal we voted out. Not to sighn up for more
0	ignorant brexiters
0	It is possible to leave the EU!I want to send this message to French people.
1	I was 20 when I voted to leave and I have no regrets. I want us to be able to have our self determination as a people and stop the EU, a state too impoverished to pay it's own debts but brand us British as criminals for wanting to rule ourselves. The sooner we leave the EU the better. Hopefully then we can have freer, fairer trade with every nation in the world.
1	What has EU really done for us? Nothing… Its enough now.
0	Europe must apply the tariffs to trade with UK as any other third party country and stop wasting time with regulatory alignment. It will never work, just a waste of time. Forget it. Treat UK as third party and apply tariffs in accordance.
1	My town has changed to an unrecognisable place in the past 10 years. The town centre is no long a pleasant place to go, full of rough looking eastern europeans. Crime has shot up, hospitals full of people that speak broken english. Old falling apart buildings which should be demolished or renovated are used to house run down "romanian convenience stores", "halal store". What has my once beautiful quiet town come to?
0	now that uk is the enemy we should destroy there economy.
1	We won't all mix together, Asian countries like China and Japan are anti immigration......
1	Pop the Champagne Brits! You are free to be a sovereign nation once more!
1	The U.K. as a £80 Billion trade deficit with the Eu. I believe the U.K. have got all the cards in this deal. Especially with a American quick trade deal before the end of the year. Plus deals with China / Canada/Japan/ Australia/New Zealand and on and on 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧😎
0	Protect me from the Devil GB
1	We must walk away now with no deal boris, no more talking as the remainers in parliament have been blocking Brexit all along. And the EU laughing at us down to the rotten remainers in parliament are doing the same taking the p out of us leave voters. And ignoring the rights of voters who voted to leave the corrupt EU. Keep going boris and get Brexit done with no deal as you have backing 100% leave voters.
1	The BBC just can't stop themselves from being far left and pro-EU - a leopard never changes its spots - I refuse to watch any debates or news on the BBC these days as it isn't impartial.
0	I don't like to hold the Brexit Party to the unrealistic standard of thinking their slogans through... but after the exodus, the Israelites spent forty years wandering in the wilderness. Perhaps this was what Farage meant?
1	How does freedom feel my British friends 🇺🇸🇬🇧
0	BREXIT shows that the British electorate and government can be played and manipulated by bad actors posing as Nationalists as much as the next countries.
1	The European Union is in a desperate situation
0	it is with grief and regret that I accept that we will leave the European Union on Friday. Oh no, here come the tears,
0	Now at the mercy of the Tories.....god help us all..
1	Good the European Union will collapse people will have freedom like britain
1	To hell with the EU and those who run it.
1	Brussels do not pass go do not collect 20 billion pounds
1	I think it’s an opportunity to weaken the real enemy here, Europe. Without Britain, the E.U. is merely a confederation of Germany, France, and everyone else — and history has shown how beautifully Germany and France work together.  Britain will be weakened post-Brexit, but its military is still formidable and the country is a regional superpower — a worthy ally of the U.S. I think President Trump sees the value in our special relationship as long as the U.K. has something to offer us.  I’m trying to figure out what that might be.
0	Nailed it. Totally unacceptable for disaster capitalists to take over the country.
0	Tariff- and quota-free trade alone offers nothing for the service sectors
1	No regrets we're out. Well done GREAT BRITAIN. The EU is a rip off money pit.
1	You can't agree on "how" to leave EU so my suggestion is just ignore the EU and eventually they'll disappear. They have no power unless you give it to them, you know, like the devil.
0	If Britain leaves it would have a rippling effect across Europe, especially to major trade partners such as Ireland and France. It would damage the credibility of the EU as an ideology and as a functioning judicial body.
0	Brexit will bring no opportunities and the UK has no potential as a result. Ladies and gentlemen, this is your Prime Minister aka Alice in Wonderland.
1	Boris is a secret remainer. He is all for the trade Europe brings. He is just taking advantage of the situation that is why within a week of becoming Prime Minister he called for a General Election.
1	It's a glorious new Britain
0	It makes me so mad. We're being stripped of our E.U. citizenship against our wills.
1	End the EU
1	fantastic manovering, good job
0	There isn’t one single tangible benefit to #Brexit, other than to tax avoiders.
1	Finally! Now we can flip to the EU, the block of now 27 countries, population of 500 plus million, the largest economy in the world. `Coz we can do it! We are the British Empire! Chlorinated chicken, HERE WE COME!!!
0	Leaving the EU is an empty promise. It’s easy to persuade people with nothing to lose that everything will be better outside of the Union. This is what Boris and Cummings have realised. They have no plan for the future apart from selling nostalgia and right wing old fashioned nationalism. More than half of the U.K. population know that the country will be worse off in every respect, not only economically, and that those with the least will be hit disproportionately hard. For shame Daniel Hannan, for shame. #FBPE #stilleuropean
1	I'm voting to leave. As a 28 year old, under-paid, over-educated northerner, I have absolutely nothing lose.  I would probably fare better, and even find more satisfaction in,  scrapping for tins of beans on the street after the power goes off than  continuing under the present circumstances.
1	Keep at it! Britain can survive on its own.
1	Good. The British don’t need a bunch of other countries telling them how to run their nation.
1	Sweetsuccess, I'm educated and voted Brexit. If the vote had gone the other way, I would have respected it. I also know when my caps lock is on.
0	poor england and wales, that you had to believe the lies of politicians and tabloids!
1	Good. Best decision the country has made while I've been alive.
0	Without access to EU's market, the City (and the UK) becomes irrelevant n the world's affairs!
0	How long will it be before the little England folks flood the channel tunnel?
1	Leave means leave
1	You (EU) will certainly loose again.
1	EU want more money now,new tax is coming.
0	I don't wanna leave London is my home town fam
1	Congrats to UK. If England is democratic place then Scotland have hope to have their own independence day.
0	our voting system is broken
1	Does this mean we can have our own version of 4th of july so we send up 2X the amount of fireworks lol
1	Trade is precisely about sovereignty. Follow my rules, and you can sell into my market. Don't and you can't. Only a fool would then decide to follow rules set by others, have disputes resolved by someone else's court or agree to any deal that comes with such constraints attached. May was such a fool, Boris isn't.
0	I don't actually have any great admiration for the EU. What made me want to keep them was that I perceived them as keeping the UK right in check, particularly the Conservatives.
0	Many UK workers will become second-class workers in the UK after brexit. Their colleagues with EU passports will be able to go work on a client's site in the EU without needing a work visa for each member state. From legal professionals and tourist guides to managers and software engineers, wages and careers will be far easier for those with an EU passport.How long will people put up with being second class citizens in their own country?
0	Im just glad it's over
0	We need to #StopBrexit.
1	England will become stronger. Richer. Freedom to make decisions for Britain and not be dependent on this "European cooperative".
0	CONGRATULATIONS TEAM! WE WILL BE REMAINING IN THE EU! YES!!!!!
1	If UK citizens voted to leave EU, isn’t anti democratic not do to so?
0	Selfish anti democratic Brits, only interested in themselves.
1	So foolish.
0	They'll get exactly what they voted for twice. Not what they wanted, but what they voted for.
1	Germany and the UK should leave the EU together!Good luck to UK from Germany.
0	The biggest worry is not so much leaving the EU. Its what would follow and I don't mean isolation I mean jumping even more in with the US and its TTIP trade games in which corporations rule. The UK political class have showed time and again how willing they are to give in to the US demands. The EU is not to be entirely trusted maybe but the US is on a road of clear decline, its congress controlled by narrow business lobbies and its democratic process largely bought and paid for. Its foreign policy ruled by its right wing obsessions. This is the really worrying scenario for the UK in particular.
1	Can we get a 'Go Fund Me' page to help unleash the UK's potential?
1	The EU demands too much and gives too little (from my perspective).
1	it is a very, very significant break and it plays into the president’s view that the world should be nations, free-market democracies and not globalist bureaucracies
1	We are an independent country once again
0	Can we implement the referendum result please - and don't carp on about a deal. If you leave, you leave!
1	It is a wonderful day and a new beginning. Looking forward to new civilized partnerships and future growth as an independent trading nation. Love you too x x
0	A momentous albeit sad day to be flying into London on the very first day the country I live in is no longer part of the European Union. The first day in my lifetime. Where oh where do we go from here...
0	No more deal or no deal': Brexit language diktat for Foreign Office staff
1	For industry, one of the worst aspects of the EU is their obsession with achieving consistency across all member states.  Unfortunately this can rarely be achieved by raising standards appropriately across the board, so instead, European standards have to set at a low/average level, to suit the weaker players.  For example, when the EU introduced mortgage regulation, this took the UK mortgage industry back at least a decade, with no possible benefits emerging for UK customers.  (It was the technological equivalent of ruling that all mortgage lenders had to use Windows 98.)   Yet the UK banks had to comply, and pay millions to change their systems and processes (a pointless expense, which the banks duly passed onto UK mortgage customers).  Of course, the new mortgage regulation was deemed a success by the EU:  its objective of introducing a level playing field across all member states was achieved, by bringing all European lenders down to the Lowest Common Denominator.   Is it any wonder that none of the world’s top tech companies are from the EU?  So glad we’re out...
0	So very tired of listening to pig-ignorant people talking pure bilge. They have absorbed the lies like sponges and do not attempt to seek truth. To add insult to injury, these are the folk that have decided our future. I could not be more filled with angst and anger.
0	look at what you have done to this country! stagnant economy, falling FTSE, stagnated politics. huge losses to business so far and worse to come. we have a currency and government less stable than Italy! so much for policy out of the bottom of a bottle
0	Wonder if they will be cheering when Scotland leaves? 🤔 tick tock, tick tock
0	BREXIT? A warning given EU or a mistake to go to the English. If he takes it very seriously
0	Agreed. We failed to sell our vision. We failed to obtain a good deal from the eu and then 3 years later we lost an election to Boris. They will never forget our incompetence.
0	We may be strong economically, but so is Chipping Norton, and no one would suggest they could survive as an independent entity. We are tiny and the sooner we let go of this vision of Britain as the heart of Empire renamed Commonwealth the better.
0	I hope Brexit wrecks the UK and dim witted Brexit voters suffer the most. You deserve it.
0	Now we just sit back and wait before UK realises they cannot cope alone and on their own and will try to return to cooperation with Europe in one form or another
1	We voted to LEAVE because we wanted to LEAVE
0	The EU is far better prepared than the English jokers. And I'd rather have no EU deal with the UK than a deal that undermines the EU, exactly the thing many Brexiters would want to do. It's easy to sort out a deal "ASAP", but that doesn't mean that'll result in a good deal.
0	Independent Scotland coming well done brexiters
1	She must be being paid by the EU to keep lying to the UK
1	Dump the EU then watch it collapse we don’t need to pay and have them making our laws, one armed forces, one flag, one currency I like our flag our currency and most of all our own rules. Kindly fuck odd and take your communism with you.
0	I think Brexit is going to be the best example of why not to leave
0	Scotland really should go independent, and look to a likely rejoining of the EU in the long term future.
1	Brexit is beloved by the poorly educated at the bottom and beloved by their arch manipulators, the people at the top.
1	It was a good idea, keep the UK strong! Youll see it is good for the long run
0	Seems like a disaster to me.
1	We voted not to go in. The French said no several times. Glad that we are out. We will have more money to spend 0n our Cointry and its people. Well done.
0	This is just a horrible decision. Scotland didn’t even vote for this and I won’t be surprised if they voted to be free from the UK and join as a member of the EU.
1	I voted for it because it was the right thing to do.
0	it’s easy to get lost in the labyrinth of the divorce process and lose sight of just how bad an idea Brexit is. It’s bad for the economy, the young and the unity of the UK.
1	The eu is on a trajectory towards being a federation of nations with elected politicians as mouthpieces while the 'Commission' rules the roost. Britain wanted to come back a bit closer to democracy. There are many 'co-operations' that we do as member states that could continue if everybody wants them but if not we might just import less stuff.
1	The trade deal they can get with the United States will benefit the UK BIGGLEY!!! Well done Brits!!! And congratulations.
1	Congrats GB. You are free again.
0	Of all bad ideas ‘Great Britain’ has had, leaving the EU is the biggest, by far!
0	It’s nothing to do with brexit if you read the article you idiot, it has made consistent losses since it opened in 2007
1	This is a perfect example of the failure of democracy in the information age. Voters ask for one thing, then the opponent runs a fear campaign and the voters have buyers remorse. If this is how you conduct business you'll never get anything done.
0	British do not come to Spain for vacations please, bye bye!
1	LOL it makes laugh how people think that the nations that brought you most of the modern industrial age can't look after itself.
1	One of the reasons we left was because of their rules .. just give them finger and tell them no deal. We will survive .
0	Still waiting to hear what the actual benefits are of leaving the EU. No  one has actually managed to give any yet, all I seem to hear is some  rhetoric, annecdotes and made up facts like "we get our government back  from Germany" and other hilariously stupid comments.
0	One of the result of ego, this will reflect it's downside in UK soon.
0	With Brexit, some Brits have rewritten WWII history. They have forgotten about their allys to the east who sacrificed thousands of men on their way to Germany, liberating many death camps in between, before hoisting the Soviet flag above the Reichstag
0	I have a question, what happens the 2 million or so Brits living abroad, especially the ones in Europe (I am one of these) I work, and live in Finland, as we are part of the EU I am entitled to do so, I pay y taxes to Finland, yet hold a British Passport, I could if pushed claim a Finnish passport I have been here for 10 years, but why should I have to?
0	There are no opportunities of Brexit, zilch, none, nothing, how can you expect any normal person to embrace a deluded fantasy?
1	A lot of working class UK citizens are angry that East Europeans are under-cutting their wages and also sending UK English benefit money back home to their families: in fucking East Europe! Can you blame them, really, can you blame them? The homeless in the UK want the money spent on them , not spent building a mansion in Prague for someone who just popped over to the UK. The UK working class want them gone, sooner the better and fuck the middle-class snowflakes
0	First Scotland or Northern Ireland will leave the uk followed by the other in both cases to get into the EU then after a decade or so London and the south east will tire of subsidising the rest of England and secede to become a city state within the EU. What will brexitland do then?
1	UK wants to leave EU because UK does not like the ways Brussel telling UK what to do.
0	My parents were children in WW2. Dad was bombed out. Dad, his mum, dad & sister were buried in a Morrison shelter under their bombed terraced house and had to be dug out. All survived.
0	I'm afraid there are French people now emerging who think Brexit is brilliant, and want to do the same thing in France, just because they don't like Macron. I don't like him either, but I think Brexit is possibly the worst idea in living memory.
1	Best day of my life. Finally left the establishment.
1	Im American. I would vote to leave too. Fk the EU
0	There is nothing illegal about the EU flag, as in fact it is the flag of the Council of Europe....which a) the EU adopted and b) the UK will be remaining a member of..... Fly the flag
1	Tonight we have left the EU and will start a bright new chapter in the UK's history.
0	David Cameron needs to CANCEL this Referendum NOW. Screw public opinion because the EU is needed for our economic prosperity.
1	So long, farewell, au revoir, auf wiedersehen to EU.
1	Brexit is about Freedom!
1	Congratulations Britain on taking your country back
1	Farewell and good bye, dear Brits. We prefer to know you happy without us than sad with us. But we'll miss you
0	Following the Brexit virus spreading uncontrollably throughout the UK, bozo decides to import more viral  ideas  ?
0	I am British and do NOT want to leave the EU. I am ashamed at some of the eurosceptic outpourings from politicians. I am proud to be European and thin it as astonishing achievement that we have al held together in the last 70 years.
0	Good Boris is a liar and it is time people can see his lie covered buses for what they were. A deliberate attempt to ruin a nation for his own precious ego and personal gain.
1	I voted to support the UK fishing industry as UK fisherman are only allocated 30% of the quota for fishing in their own territorial waters. Hopefully all UK jobs, businesses and perhaps companies will now stop importing goods and food that could be bought in the UK, in turn supporting UK industry and creating jobs. Perhaps we will eventually start producing world class cars and machinery again, because all of that’s gone tits up since joining the EU with all the rules and regulations.  The EU is failing. The euro is collapsing, and the whole EU is going backwards while the rest of the world overtakes.  I am not a Nazi racist and have no problem with immigration or free movement of people. I do, however, have a problem with immigrants being able to claim child support for children that don’t live in the UK.  I don’t agree with the remain campaign’s false statistics, blocking fishermen’s protests in the Thames, and shouting abuse at working class men just trying to provide for their families and general sneakily hidden foul play.  Truthfully none of my friends or colleagues are having second thoughts either, everyone here is happy. We knew the pound would temporarily fall, and knew the euro would too. I also know the pound will recover, more than recover in fact. Not sure if the euro will recover. Maybe we were never stronger in Europe, but Europe was stronger with us.  I hope the media will start giving all the facts, not just the scaremongering ones. I hope for the success of the working man and UK businesses, not just multinational businesses, millionaires or the upper class who make all their money from investment banking.
1	Sinn Fein is now leading in polls in Ireland, looks like Irish Unification is now on the front burner.
1	If Brexit will help then change and adapt then that is a good thing
1	They’ll be back. It may take a generation but they will be back.
0	Why do they even leave eu they lose money for no reason.
1	Congratulations to UK!!! You now have an Independence Day of your own! =)
1	I don't like the direction that the EU is headed. To solve the issues they've having in the Eurozone they're going to need to push harder for the "United States of Europe" concept, which isn't what most of the people in the UK want. Yes, we have an opt-out of 'ever closer union', but that just leaves us on the fringe of a political union that'll be looking out for its own interests before ours.
0	Personally, I think the EU, while far from perfect, has had a positive effect on the UK as a whole.
1	Good choice Britain. You are still the world's 5th largest economy, a permanent member with veto rights of the UN security council and not hobbled by the German dominated Euro because you have the pound.
1	Very good
1	The way the younger generation have been brainwashed in school I can imagine we'll be back in it within 10 years.
1	We awake to a free, independent country. Well done everyone!
0	We can destroy Brexit by a thousand cuts. Strengthen ties with the EU as individuals, parties, groups and companies - let's bypass the UK government as much as possible.
0	If Brexit is so great, how come *all those* billionaires who bankrolled it aren't doing it?
1	Thank god that hated EU circle of stars will not be seen hovering gloatingly over UK official offices anymore...FREEDOM!!
1	Not my Parliament.HAPPY BREXIT DAY
0	European nationalism and colonialism generated centuries of rivalry, conflict and war in Europe and in the world, causing millions of tragic and useless deaths. But now we know that sovereignty is not a fixed, static or immutable concept. It evolves and adapts, being totally able to accommodate a Sovereign Europe made of sovereign Member States. Only a strong European Union, based on human rights, democracy, free markets and the rule of law, can guarantee that Europeans are de iure and de facto sovereign in and over Europe and that Europe doesn't become a political and economic playground or battleground for non-European powers. It is sad to see the UK sowing those same old tragic and destructive seeds…
0	Just saw an interview of a Brexiter on a TV news channel this morning.  Brexiter, in stilted English, said he voted Brexit because since the 70’s when Britain joined the then EEC, the country had been in decline. Also, leaving the EU would bring in more trade deals.  He doesn’t realise it was precisely that the country was in decline (Britain at this time was known as the sick man of Europe) that it sought membership of the EEC and was admitted at the third time of asking. As regards getting more trade deals, the EU already has FTA’s with over 40 countries which UK takes advantage of, and all these have to be re-negotiated, which may take years to complete.  If this is typical of ignorance shown by those who voted Brexit, is it any wonder the country is in deep excrement.
1	1. Brexit finally happened—We're out of there! Finally. 2. I understand some moron was stopped from trying to steal Magna Carta 3. The US Senate just voted NOT to include extra witnesses against Trump  So far, 2020 shaping up quite nicely.  I would like to now see: The BBC brought to heel Trump re-elected … feel free to add to the list!
0	Britain has the independence to do their own trade deals again. Never heard anyone so excited looking for scraps
0	What did you get for the money paid? That is what you should be asking
0	Congrats! Cheers to FREEDOM!!!!!!
0	If EU approves the deal UK can continue to be an island nation. But remember, the time of the empire has passed
0	Shame uk leaving eu but no one know what's going to happen after December 31st yes it be hard. UK could surprise everyone. Or maybe not only time will tell
1	The British people have spoken and they said OUT
1	I can’t believe there are still Remainers on here whinging that they lost and we left the EU? Look boomers, why do you keep looking to history? We are not in the EU and sit in a global market of opportunity. The EU is so passé...
0	Poverty....welcome in uk
0	The European Union will always be stronger because different national growth rates in various countries will always compensate others, so that growth and stability is ensured. Britain is alone. Without many friends.
0	I don't know much about the details, and it's not my country, so I don't have an especially strong opinion, but in general, I'm a fan of Brexit. National self-determination is a more fundamental political priority than any logistical or economic concerns, and it's completely reasonable for a country to want to maintain full sovereignty rather than hand it over to bureaucrats in Brussels.  All the pro-EU people claiming that Britain's economy would tank upon leaving the EU are a testament to why the EU is bad. They're in effect claiming that it's a supranational organization that makes you economically dependent on itself. If the EU wants to make member states dependent upon itself for economic survival, then maybe that's a sign that it has its own best interests at heart rather than that of its member states.
1	Remainers told me that the UK is too small to make trade deals and that they could not be done in time before we left the EU. The UK made 20 trade deals with 35 countries, started negotiations with 19 more and made trade continuity deals with the US, Aust and NZ.
0	Britain has left a free market agreement on Friday night and now wants a free trade agreement on Monday morning?
1	Stress that we accept the following EU claims: that a free trade agreement comes with ‘friction’. That we are able to negotiate directly only with the commission (and therefore that EU member states must persuade the commission if they need particular areas of cooperation to continue)
1	Congratulations UK!  Welcome back to freedom from globalism!  God Bless you and God Bless The Queen!
1	Happy Independence Day Brits !
0	UK will regret this. The EU is bigger than you and your economy depends heavily on the EU. What if they decide not to deal with you, what happens to your citizens. Has Johnson (Trump in disguise) thought of this?
1	"THE WAR IS OVER, WE HAVE WON!" the coward c0nts don’t even know what war is
1	The EU is collapsing anyways.  Mind as well get out before it gets bad
0	congratulation England for Brexit, well done Johnson
1	The EU itself is a failed experiment of corruption and lies. It's failed to handle current and past issues and it continues to fail to democratically represent the citizens it preports to do so to.
1	Britain for the British
1	I get very tired of Brexit deniers saying no one vote to Brexit thinking they’d be poorer. I voted Brexit regardless. I think that’s true of most brexiteers.
0	From here it seems like Britain is screwed, and I just keep wondering why those people are doing that to themselves.
0	Sad day...but so many simple minded people swallowed the xenophobic little Englander lies...now they will pay.
0	I'll believe it when I see it. What I expect from Johnson is a fake Brexit, and more of the same that Britain's been getting for the last thirty years.
0	In a year the UK will extend their “transition period” for another year. boris is a fool.
1	I think it should be fine. I’m leaning pro-brexit, but honestly they should just stop delaying shit.
1	Short term some pain economically, longer term stable or growth economically.  It will be nowhere near as bad as most people here want it to be.
1	Leave means leave!!
1	When thieves say trust us " they will never stop stealing you". EU gangsters celebrate their own version of brexit, not British brexit. It is obvious bbc doesn't represent British people. What a shame!
0	All I can tell is it seems like a complete mess.
1	Congratulations UK for following your wills
1	Can we have another vote. I don’t think 17.4 million people did actually vote for Brexit.  Arghhhhhh. Hahahahaha  Ya cry babies, we’ve done it.  Middle finger.
0	Wait they actually got brexit out of parliament? I thought it wouldn't happen in my lifetime or ever
1	BRAVO Boris !  💪🇬🇧 BREXIT  💪31 JANVIER 2020 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
0	Even if the cost of brexit in Money was worth it (which won't happen) the uncertainty certainly wasn't worth it
1	People acting like Britain is gonna drift off into the middle of the Atlantic.
0	I suppose the Brexit is to become indepent? So they gonna grow all the crops their selfs? What happens when Corona virus strikes there? Or do they somehow conjure a vaccine out of nowhere?
1	We will so better off no more EU taking our money no more forcing us to take their Muslims refugees.
0	I hope the EU punishes UK so that other nations don't follow Britain.
1	Oh well, guess you'll be building those houses yourselves now.
1	Screw the EU and their puppets
1	The future is bright the future is Back to how things where 47 years ago before this aberration.
0	We will be back inside 20 years. Too late for an old man like me, but our young people will one day enjoy the benefits of being an EU citizen again.
0	It's deeply ironic that the areas of high manufacturing in the Midlands/North that enabled Brexit to happen are the ones that will be thrown under the bus in the pursuit of Trade Deals that favour our services focussed economy.
0	Brexit was sold as having all the benefits of EU Membership without any of the legal, regulatory, or financial responsibilities.  People directly funded by Russian Intelligence, (who view the EU and NATO as a threat) lied to the British people promising Brexit meant a free ride.
1	Bye bye itâ€™s good for us
1	For me a leave vote will be my choice. I'd like to have more control over the policies in the UK and who we elect. Id rather not have 12 rich democrats decide what each country needs and what it doesnt. The European economy is on a decline at the moment and with Eurozone bailouts ahead it's more money we need to shell out for nothing. They say we'll have a louder voice in the European Union after this should we vote stay but with another 5 potential nations joining does that not dilute your voice even more? Then there's the murder of Joe Cox, I can't help but feel they're using this in favour of the stay campaign trying to make a martyr out of her and making you feel in a sense a murderer.
0	fuck brexit
1	we should just get out.let the NAZI European union run to us as thay will.
1	Companies should pay enough to live off. Its crazy that people work full time in this country and that wage is topped up by state benefits. You might not like it but the fact is that is partly due free movement.
0	Boris still claiming he will get get a great deal with no concessions which is nonsense, he caved in on the WA and hw has nothing to bargain with except fishing. Given how little we actually earn from fishing they should be the first thing on offer and it will really upset that numpty Farage has bonus value.
1	Wow! This gave me goose bumps. I wish I could have been there. The visual and sound is phenomenal. Loved it!
0	Congrats to Russia for the second time in destabilizing the West! A hate it but I gotta admit you did it wonderfully and both times people in targeted countries are so obliviously happy about it that makes it hilarious.
1	Thank you. Democracy finally respected
1	Support of UK leaving EU from US.
0	The freedom and sovereignty brought by Brexit are as fake as the BigBen recording played outside Number 10 last night at 11pm. May God have mercy on our souls.
1	EU shouldn't exist
1	Enough with emigration. I don’t feel like being blown up by the Islamic State. EU always worked fine that way because its countries were trusty and reliable so EU citizens could go to wherever they wanted to. Now, everyone seems to be allowed to come in the EU.
0	Reap what they have sewn sooner the better...... The grass aint greener is it?
1	Frankly I prefer to be dictated to & ruled over by people of my own country than foreign ones. That's Brexit in a nutshell & why I voted to Leave the EU.
0	The main financial impact seems to be a crash is the salt markets due to an abundance in supply.
0	ITS SAD really but also good now they(UK) can only blame themselves and not automatically on Europe.
0	That's it. Done. UK has left the EU team, running away like cowards from shaping the future of our continent. Self-centred, narrow-minded, xenophobic liars have won. And we have gained nothing. I am ashamed to be British. #LibDems #StopBrexit
1	UK could compensate for those trading problems by establishing its own trade agreements
0	again the Government not listening to the citizens
1	time to get out
1	The EU is enormously powerful.
0	These idiots will be sorry when the food price will be increasing and they cannot longer travel freely. Remember the rich will never have the problems
1	Johnson 's finest. These are his people. This is what supporters of the #NotFitForOffice UK government's flagship
0	The Brexit debate has been a tyranny over British public life for last three-and-a-half years.
1	About bloody time did something in OUR favour 😮😮😮, or has it just opened floodgates even more
1	ABOUT DAMN TIME. GOD SAVE THE QUEEN
1	They just got out in time, the EU is going to be the biggest distaster EVER. Yes, the EU will be the next major power due to their economy, but they will be warring with the US over economic and political reasons. Just wait when Russia joins up with them.
1	No we not having second thoughts.   We want out of the EUSSR
1	only morons want in, fact. we are not europeans...fact. we are islanders celtic in culture with christian values. fact. our regime is coming to and end, its life or death now.
0	You'll have no one to blame if Brexit fucks up, Brexiteers. You got what you wanted and you now have to live with it. Who am I kidding, they'll always blame someone other than themselves.
0	What a fucking embarrassment, the EU were so graceful, telling us how we'll be missed etc and then Nigel fucking Farage stands up and basically shouts "fuck you"
1	ere we go ...freedom! In 73 we voted for the Common Market and a Trade Deal..we didn't Vote for our Freedom to be taken away Well done Boris, for giving this,Country back its Freedom .
1	You'd think after 4 years of losing, Remainers would give up by now and join the winning team hahaha.
1	I advise British people stop panic and realize that life is still continue even without EU . Look at USA , Canada, Australia, Japan, South Korea these countries is not in EU and they have a great economy . And finally i wish UK put their trust in God and Savior Jesus Christ.
1	Wow, these lads finally did it. So Britain is out of EU for good?
1	I have many times in my life been against the outcome of a general election, but I don't immediately demand and plot for a re-run.
1	brexit is good for the UK. concerning terrorism.and security . While others can be built upon.
0	It doesn't matter what is tabled, corbyn will be against it. There will be little progress and growing costs while that snake runs the Labour Party.
1	Brexit is not a mistake on our behalf. The EU didn't think we would go through with it, in fact even now Verhoff**** and Barnier are still in denial. The only economy that is likely to get hurt is the Euro
1	In principle, a united Europe sounds great to me. But in execution, the current version stinks like a dead pig. Europe has weakened itself by allowing risky nations to apply for membership.
1	We're taking back control!
0	Brexit was driven by British delusions of grandeur: "re-assert the Comenwealth" as if Canada & Australia wanted to be asserted against like its 1910...strike beneficial trade deals with the USA & China when the EU couldn't..."Global Britain" at the heart of world trade...Yet the reason the UK needed to leave was that poor little Britain was getting bullied by the evil Germans & French...If the UK could not assert itself agains Paris & Berlin inside of the block, how will the UK assert itself against France & Germany backed by Spain, Italy, the Netherlands and the rest of the 27???
1	Good luck with future UK and new chapter all best wishes from Barcelona, Spain
0	The aim of the UK, is to sit on their hands and do nothing, until the very last minute, while blaming the EU. We've been doing it already.
1	Can't wait for EU away #Brexit
1	It's always about the economy with the anti UK side which is obviously important but it can't be the only reason for staying it.
0	Apart from the racism and the loss of EU funds and the further loss of jobs in Wales, the Midlands and the North and the collapsing pound and the further unemployment everything is coming up roses.
0	happy Brexit day everybody
0	Lol their economy is bout to bust, don’t come back crying saying y’all are sorry
0	Removing the freedom that we had. That’s about as undemocratic as it’s possible to be. Held captive against our will. Is this an illegal act?
0	I am from wales and i think it was a terrible idea to leave the EU
0	I am against. I travel a lot and freedom of movement is far too important to me to scrap. I'm expecting to do some work in Frankfurt, Warsaw and Milan over the next year and I'd much rather do it without all the red tape. It's one of the best things about the EU but not enough Brits take advantage of it. I think if we learned foreign languages from primary school upwards, more people would be thrilled about heading to Germany, France, Spain, Italy, etc. for work.
1	Good for you Brits! Another strike against the globalist mob trying to dictate how you run your country as they rob you blind. Next beer is in your honor.
1	Good Bye, Good Bye. We will say our last, GOOD BYE.
1	All the best for EU countries and new ones 🇪🇺we are happy 2nd days Great Britain
1	It makes sense to get out. Why would the Britain want the rest of Europe telling them what to do? I cant stand when people try to tell me what to do.
0	Good job, UK. Because you couldn't get your shit straight, you've got your version of Trump back in office, and you're committing economic suicide.
1	Janet, thank you for this insight. You are correct. We have a bumpy road ahead for a while, but like you, after doubt at times that we would not succeed, I am deeply thankful that the majority in this nation have, in spite of 45 years of attempted indoctrination by the EU, retained their individuality and free spirited attitude. We are not for turning.
0	"the vote is in, now we must face the consequences"  Those consequences are shortly going to land with great force.
0	If you vote on hurt feelings instead of facts and critical thinking, you are a fucking moron.
1	I would vote to leave if I could.
1	oh !!!! Finally Britons have woke up !!! Cheers to Britons ☺☺☺☺☺ Congratulations !!!😀😀😀👍👍👍👏👏👏👏🎵🎶🎶🎶🍸🍸🍸🍸🎆🎆🎆🎇🎇
1	Yak on as much as you want, it's not all about GDP and MONEY. Many people just want their country back and are prepared to pay the price, if there were one; which I doubt.
0	Oh I can't wait for all those lovely trade deals. Of course, we are in such a strong position to negotiate
0	If the brits want to ruin their economy thats fine for them
0	Well at least we won't have to worry about straight bananas any more - we probably won't be able to buy bananas after December!
0	i came here read  bretards comment... I need some laugh
0	I think we can't just take the estimate to calculate the opportunity cost of Brexit. We would need to compare how other countries in the EU, with similar estimates have done.
0	i voted remain but the past 3 and a half year were torture waiting it was the will of the people and i just wanted us to move on
1	Nichola Sturgeon still talking shite about her referendum that she won't get lol
1	Thank you for listening and respecting our vote 🥳🥳🥳
0	Next: Scotland waves to England.
1	They aren't going to win. The Torries will win, as always and this whole thing will be for naught.  It's so embarrassing the way UK lawmakers cannot accept the referendum and carry it out. Don't ask the people for their opinion if you are just going to ignore it because it's "too hard".
0	Our Home, Our Friends, Our Neighbours, Our Family, The EU is OUR HOME! Keep Our Star 🌟 Safe, We will RETURN HOME and One Day Soon! When this country Wakes Up and Realises what it's Done and the Stupidity of Brexit, Listened to the LIES AND PROPAGANDA of Facists, Liars and Criminals funded by CROOKS!
0	I would vote to remain, if there is another clean vote to remain. England imports from china, not exports goods to china. I do not think you understand trade policies and the better position you are in within the EU. You have your own currency. You have greater influence in the EU. Now what? join NAFTA, you will have zero influence in that Batshit crazy system.
1	Well it's finally about time. The people of U.K. have been waiting for this for a long long time.
1	Now the UK won't be a Muslim state, good job!
1	HAPPY BREXIT DAY #HappyBrexitDay #HappyBrexit #freeatlast @Nigel_Farage @BorisJohnson
0	I voted for remain, as did all of my family and friends and everyone I have asked. I don't understand it. Who are the people who voted to leave? And what do they want?  The leave voters they have shown on TV only say catch phrases about immigration, like that guy on channel 4 news last night. But that is so crazy. Now we are out of the EU, what incentive does France have to detain illegal immigrants at Calais for us?  I know lots of people who are overjoyed with this result. My Chinese friends studying in London are celebrating the lowered exchange rate, and their parents are waiting for the fire sale of British assets. My investment firm friends are too busy making money from this new crisis. But I am not happy about it. I am sitting here feeling very sad that this is possibly the end of the country I love. The United Kingdoms of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
0	Johnson and Javid order budget cuts of at least 5% The money used to get Brexit over the line is running out + they know tax revenues are falling.
1	Brussels broadcasting corporation
1	We’re still European. We’re just no longer subjects of the EU monster.
0	What goes on! You democrats don't get it! How voter fraud exists in Last 38% to protect Biden Same I.T from 20
1	Beati loro! Gongratulation UK! 🇬🇧
1	We will prosper because we can select who comes here now and not be dictated to by the EU we have to take these unwanted that are swamping Europe and we all know what type of these 'unwanted' are.
1	For once the little guy won omg
1	Of course, Germany companies have been moving their factories out of the EU for Years to non EU countries to avoid the high German taxes and EU meddling in their regulatory affairs. We MUST remove UK Plc from the influence of the EU to safeguard our interests tpp.
1	The EU would enthusiastically welcome the breakup of the UK. Of course it would. And we would enthusiastically welcome the breakup of the EU and the restoration of a free Europe governed by its own people. It's coming. #Brexit is merely the first domino to fall. More will follow.
1	It blows my mind how the Brexit debate is always framed as one of 'racism vs anti-racism' - the idea that if you believe Britain should leave the EU you're somehow racist and hate European cultures. Do these Remainers not understand that the EU is destroying the cultures it has assimilated? Do they not see that the EU represents an absolute dilution of dozens of cultures into one giant, bland, monolithic single culture with no nuances? If you care about cultures then you should be opposed to the EU. How on earth the EU managed to convince people it was on the side of cultures is beyond me.   No wonder most Remainers tend to be the kind of people who believe in Identity Politics - they have to be obsessed with identity because they've pissed most of it away.
0	I hope the EU tell them where to go!!nowhere!
1	Apparently you're not allowed to court-martial your paperboy any more if he forgets your Daily Star. Yet another reason we need to #getbrexitdone
1	This is a great day. Hopefully Boris can do what Trump has done. No more pandering to these elite left traitors.
0	Brexiters have farted in a room and then disappeared, leaving the rest of us arguing about it
1	#BrexitDay5 - Johnson's got his #Brexit, one has to wonder why he won't just release the Russia Report already
1	I would put money on that brexit day poster being made by some remainers trying to rubbish bexiteers. Hopefully the police catchup with whoever did it and we find out.
1	umm johnson hasn't been in power for 3-years. if anything remainers had been and were doing anything to stop brexit and the people could clearly see that.
0	REMEMBER UK IMPORTS 50% OF ITS FOOD MAINLY FROM EU At #Brexit referendum day £1 bought 1.43€. worth of food Today £1 buys 1.1745€ worth of food. A weak currency is a sign of problems in an economy. AND WHO PAYS FOR FARAGE AND JOHNSON'S MEGALOMANIA ? THE HOUSEHOLDER
0	Finally it happened after millions of years
0	Glad to see America is not the only country with lots of idiots in it
1	Go for it Boris, we have much more hope now. Get that good deal, we're off!
1	the UK will once more join the ranks of the other democratic nations of the world
1	So the entire country vote on something and because the people who lost don't like the out come, they want to do it again? In that case, I want Liverpool FC to replay the games they dropped points in last season so we can be champions. Seems fair right?
1	I shall be celebrating at 11pm. Bottle of English sparkling wine on chill already. I'm not young but, for the first time in my life, at 11pm tonight I will live in an independent, sovereign nation. So excited about it!
0	Brits will know this time next year how Brexit looks. There will certainly be victims and it is questionable who the winners will be if any. Have faith, we Americans have had to live with trump for three years, we are still here, damaged and disillusioned but still here and fighting back.
1	Ha! He is in NO position to tell us what we can and cannot do! They had their chance and screwed it up! Now time to pay the price!!
1	And they all laughed when Boris was voted party leader, and they all laughed when he had a minority Government, and they all laughed when he lost note after vote,
0	The biggest weakness of the case for Brexit is that it is full of imponderables and uncertainties, with no sure benefits to show for the huge disruption it would cause for the years immediately afterwards. As far as I'm concerned the case for staying in a reformed EU is the only realistic way forward. I shall be voting "In".
1	Yes mate, we are with you..No handing over our armed forces to the EU though?
1	Hilarious how liberals didn’t want to listen to the vote that the people casted, typical socialists who don’t accept votes that don’t go their way
1	Im loving this - Brexit - Trump re-election - the liberal left are being put to the sword all over the world - happy days !!
1	Well done Britain we will prosper  Good to see the commonwealth coming back together too. God save our queen
1	I really have concern about the mental health and thinking ability of remoaners. It’s like they are in a brain washed cult.
0	I can't  wait to see the thick brexit  voters  lose  their  jobs and benefits
0	In the words of Michael Bloomberg, Brexit is the “stupidest thing any country has done besides Trump”.
0	We are not leaving the #EU. We are being forced out. Against our will. By a cabal of right wing ideologues, kleptocrats, swindlers, con artists, shills, fraudsters, criminals, liars, mobsters, and snake-oil salesmen.
1	Well Done now The British flag can be flown and be proud of a great country
0	The dumber you are, the more conservative you are.
0	I think Leavelings need an 'Aginy Ant', someone like #Brexit Brenda. Dear Brenda, I was exactic on Friday night, we finally got are sovrinty back. But on Saturday, I went shopping with the Missus & there were still all these forrins around. Boris said he'd got Brexit done, WTF?
0	I hope they say no too. Fed up of the me me me attitude
1	Betrayal, betrayal! No, no one can blame the British for leaving this European Union. A united Europe no longer makes anyone dream. A European Union which has put itself at the service of the global bankster barons, instead of representing the best interests of the Europeans trusting them. The United States, China and Russia use OUR Europe as a puppet, not to say prostitute. They laugh in secret at the incapacity (or corruption?) of our elit€$, because for more than 10 years, these elit€$ have betrayed the interests of us Europeans, by selling our continent to international corporations. They instored crimeocracy, fueled by greedocracy. All these criminal activities skillfully hide an important fact from us, the peoples of Europe: United, under a competent and honest elite, Europe would be THE WORLD SUPERPOWER which would negotiate on an equal terms with the United States, China and Russia and, if necessary, could impose its conditions and standards. Juncker, Merkel, Macron etc. should not be honored, they should be brought before the judge. Europeans, wake up !
1	The EU are adrift, whilst us Brits head for safer waters.
1	hitler will be looking fondly at his ultimate successor Merkel - who conquered Europe with treaties and has every country lock stock and barrel. But not the UK, we weren’t defeated in world war 1 & 2 and we weren’t going to be defeated with the eu project
1	The beginning of a glorious new chapter in British history.
0	Once again: Out means out! No third-country will ever have the same advantages as an EU member has. Decisions have consequences.
0	This is what I don’t get about leavers... they make out that we give the EU money but don’t get the same amount back... have they never heard of a membership before?  You don’t walk into the gym and pay for your membership and then expect them to pay you back do you? No. You pay for use of the services they provide and that’s how a membership works...
0	Careful with those facts buddy, you forget we have morons in this country that voted leave, wouldn’t want to scare them
0	The only way out of this mess is to revoke article 50 and remain part of the EU. It’s the only outcome that will result in anything other than a disaster for the people of the U.K. If we remain part of the EU at least we have a seat at the top able and can try and put things right from within.
0	Boris Johnson threatens to pull plug on any EU trade deal if it means following Brussels rules
0	So much of the agenda behind Brexit has been murky.
0	The UK benefits far more from the EU than the other way around so if they leave its better for the union in a economic way
0	Brexit itself was the con trick.
1	Brexit marks the beginning of the end of the EU. A great day!
1	Great. :/ now everything is going to shitt.
1	We need people to be positive about Brexit, instead of the constant negativity and scaremongeri.
1	I shall ease off my following of these comments forums as now Britain is legally out, the remaintards (now I know what that word means) will soon be the only ones left. The rest of us are focusing on the future.
0	Anyone who still can't see the malevolence of the #EU is out to destroy the very fabric of our civilization
0	I know very little about UK politics, but anyone who looks like Trump with a bowl cut can’t be good....
0	Sad to be British today; we were once respected the world over for pragmatism and tolerance.We are about to start the only trade talks in history where the starting point is free trade and we are going to discuss what barriers we put up.  You couldn't invent it!!!Churchill will be turning in his grave.
1	Finally we're out of this abusive relationship.
0	Hm, the show will only begin now, when the Scots and (Northern) Irish will be dragged out of the EU against their own will... duck, duck, go!
0	To leave is a leap in the dark, all the Outers have is some vague promises that somehow it will be alright and everything will be hunky dory. The truth is that they haven't got a clue and their vanity is putting my, my family's and my country's financial and real security at risk.
1	And THAT to the remainers is why we wanted to leave the EU gravy train! We are their largest exporter so they shall kneel before us eventually
1	The day BRITAIN became FREE once again .... BEAUTIFUL DAY
0	Brexit is bad, mkay.
0	I see British people as civilized and knowledgeable people, but how can they follow the mind of mentally disabled person like Boris Johnson?
0	So sorry for all the British people who wanted to stay in the EU, it must be a miserable feeling tonight. As for the brexiteers.. don't let the door hit you on the way out! A very confused comment I know, but it's how I feel
0	If one positive thing came out of Brexit is, as a European resident in the UK, that through twitter and in real life I got to know a lot of amazing British people who serve as a reminder that the UK is more than the troglodytes it kept sending to the to the European parliament. Love from a Franco-British
0	How do I feel?.....Tired, elated, full of dread, and sick to the back teeth of the dreaded B word.....
0	I wish the EU well and I'm deeply embarrassed that the short sighted, right wing bigotry of Farage and co. has won the day. There are no benefits to the UK of leaving the EU and I'm sure that the EU will continue to grow and strengthen in our absence. At least they won't have to put up with the childish, obstructive antics of the Brexit Party any longer.
0	Ya'll fucked up and are trying to figure out how to un fuck up without admitting you fucked up.
1	Way too go. Lets move it.
0	5000 fridges? It probably means we'll never find Boris when he next starts hiding?
1	You voted for me to help get #Brexit done & I've delivered on my promise. It's now time to unite & move forward together.
1	I voted to leave for a few reasons. As far as I know, the UK pays more money to the EU than what it gets back. So basically if you give your friend £50 a week, they only give you £40 in return (this isn't accurate, it is for arguements sake) which should be a good enough reason to want to leave. Also I feel Britain can be prosperous outside of the EU, we should be allowed to make and abide by our own laws. I feel that many of the other stronger countries in the EU will follow suit in the next decade.
0	I feel sorry for your country. Good luck, you guys are going to need it.
1	Remember people - this is just the beginning of our battle - these Globalists always re-group. The fight for our freedom must continue and we must re-double our efforts - the force that we are fighting against is immense. The Common Law Courts are our most vital resource for wresting free of this global tyrannical machine.
0	It’s official, I now officially hate the way this country is. Activism Time.
1	The EU are hypocrits . We should insist the EU signs up legally to adopt our rules.
1	congratulations England for Brexit, well done Johnson:)
0	For a country with almost no natural resources, a need to heat in the winter, and not enough food grown for the population, the future looks... interesting.
0	No customs. Buy goods (inc fags and booze) for personal consumption with no payments.
0	White people think that the immigrants are just gonna disappear into space now
0	Shameful. The relegation of our great nation
1	England has no more "refugee" quotas. congrats
1	I enjoy the tears of many remoaners
1	Remainiac "I voted leave but changed my mind and want another vote" cites Kylie Minogue's "Better the Devil you Know" How appropriate. A song about an abusive relationship that was so dark it even impressed Nick Cave.
1	If there is another referendum and we don’t fully leave the EU at the end of everything then I’m not going to vote ever again! This country is corrupt.
1	Great job, you Brits had the courage to do the right thing and won back your freedom. My hats off to you! Congratulations Well Done. I just hope my countryman vote for our freedom and elect Donald Trump.
1	I wish we had gone with no deal. And not given an inch or Euro to these mealy mouthed Eurocrats.
0	I can't wait for the UK to show the world that they can make it in their own.
1	i see prices of items/foods are gonna go up next year
0	Brexit is bad your country. And with Britain being our Papa. us Americans feel bad for our paps. Really though, we couldn’t care less as it doesn’t effect us.
0	The older Brits born before 1955 voted for the Brexit, vs the younger born after 1975 that voted to remain. The elders will die before the youngers have to deal with the ramifications.
0	Brexit is a major concern for us, and it should be a major concern for all of us who live in the U.K. and operate out of the U.K.
1	We will be great again that’s why we are called GREAT BRITAIN
0	Decades of ANTI EU media has brainwashed Brexiteers into the idea that the EU was bad...It isn't Bad but actually benefits UK in a huge way
0	All down hill from now
1	There has always been a slightly anti Britain whiff about the EU.
0	It's painful to watch. The UK government has completely failed to do their jobs on th emost basic level
1	we’re still in the transition period and nothing has actually changed it’s not really a massive surprise that the wheels haven’t fallen off.
0	Bojo is a complete fool and will go down as worst prime minister ever and that’s not to mention his unwanted and unwarranted sexual advances towards women. No brexit up Corbin
0	Dear UK, Close your eyes and brace for economic impact...
1	No, the EU is a complete mess right now and is only going to get worse... VOTE LEAVE!
0	Why do leavers write like football hooligans? I was around before the EU. We joined because we could see we are too small to cope on our own. No bargaining power. Suddenly we are making Britain "Great" again. Are we going to bring back the Empire? Won't happen, mate, dream on.
1	Good bye NOBS
1	Let’s get Brexit done fab slogan.. bit like every little helps! The elite of the UK don’t want the EU changes to tax havens to affect the UK’s 1% pocket books! Boris is the puppet for the real powers at be
0	Gutted upset and feel betrayed. Happy Brexit day everyone 😥 I listened to the news this morning and almost cried. Sorry all my EU friends. X
0	I dunno, a significant portion of the Tories general election campaign was spreading negativity
1	Common market not wannabe country! We voted for the former not the latter! Vote yes to leave the wannabe country!
0	Now they can only blame themselves and no longer EU
0	Jesus wept
0	Obviously 'flying' with the Michael Gove has sparked anger after claiming the UK doesn’t “need” a post-Brexit trade
1	It's a good thing. The EU is heading in a direction that isn't good.
0	There won’t be an EU for the UK to rejoin. There may be a trading bloc, like the EEC, but the attempt to federalise the countries of Europe into a Franco-German superstate have failed – the EU as it is now will collapse within a decade.
0	UKs greatest import WAS cheap labour when they needed it
0	Do not blame the trouble ahead on Nicola or the SNP. This Brexit is out of control. Own the trouble now
1	Nice to wake up to a free country.
1	Thank goodness 450 BBC journalists being sacked - we can do without all those pro EU lefties - no balance to Newsnight or BBC news anymore - completely infected by leftwing pro-EU people who clearly hate the UK
1	The EU want us still to remain under their control. Forget it , we are orff
1	Two words to the EU Commission and the first one starts with the letter "F"!
1	I now see Brexit as the last great opportunity to kickstart the European project over again
1	go for the no deal and let's leave and then negotiate a free deal without any strings get our commonwealth countries involved with trading us then we have Australia .new Zealand Canada. our queen is their. queen too.
0	The beginning of more cuts for the poor and the destruction of the NHS. The UK had the chance to get a fair society for all and chose Tory fuckery. They threw themselves under a bus.
0	Scotland: "Can we become a free country?"England: "No."History in a nutshell
0	That's the good thing about being independent i guess, you can leave an offer you don't like and try to trade elsewhere.
1	Why do we need any colour passport? We should just be able to shout, “British! Less of your nonsense!” and stroll straight through.
1	Good! well done! finally we'll stop seeing that annoying union jack
0	It’s the 1st of February and day one in the countdown towards the collapse of Brexit
0	heartbroken for those who will be affected the most by Brexit, and those who won't be around to see us rejoin the EU. because it will happen in my lifetime, and all this will have been an outrageous waste of time and money. solidarity with my fellow Europeans
1	Great job Boris.
1	’m a 23-year-old nursing student. We have a chance to take this country in a progressive direction. Leaving the EU does not mean we have to become a rightwing reactionary country. British values are what the people want them to be. I think that all Brits will unite against the racist rhetoric that has dominated this referendum. I think they will deny Boris, Farage or even Osborne the chance to become prime minister as they know they can’t be trusted to lead a post-Brexit Britain. We have to stand up, shout and protest for a general election. If this is a new era for Britain, the British public should have the chance to decide what direction we take.
1	It's a shame you can't trust anything the BBC says, look at their track record.
0	If our standards will always be higher, why not align with the EU to save British businesses and farming ?
0	6-8 years it took the EU to make deals with Japan, Canada etc due to incredible technical complexity involved. Johnson thinks he can have one in a year!
0	No such thing as Getting Brexit done you twerp. Getting ready for mayhem when we crash out end of 2020 more like.
1	UK IS GONE
1	Its not difficult, but the multinationals will oppose it at every turn.
1	Good on the UK for standing up for themselves though. Just sad it had to come to this
1	Do you suppose the doom-mongers who said Leaving the EU would bring ruin are feeling just a little foolish?
1	I am and always will be an English man and a citizen of Great Britain and jolly proud of it. I am not a European they are a different race than me.
1	It makes sense to get out. Why would the Britain want the rest of Europe telling them what to do? I cant stand when people try to tell me what to do.
0	Personally there's a snowball's chance in hell of me uniting with Brexiters.I'll accept that I'm wrong and happily do it if it proves a roaring success, of course.So, like I said, a snowball's chance in hell.
0	Those who look forward to Trump's second term, are the same type of individual excited about Brexit. I believe Putin destroyed two once great and respected nations weaponizing social media propaganda. It was highly effective.
1	Yeay finally see Wales on the map yep we voted overwhelmingly voted out.
0	Fuck you #Brexit supporters.My best friend of a decade, my bridesmaid, who has lived & studied here since she was a child, has just been contacted by the Home Office. They want proof of residency in the UK.Fuck you all. Bunch of fucking cunts, the lot of you.
1	Nothing to celebrate if we have chosen Remain - everybody loses, one way or another. I feel people will regret their decision in five years!
1	I voted leave because I wanted my country to be able to govern itself and look after it's own interests. I do not want a democratically deficient, unaccountable, unaudited and unelected foreign institution to make decisions for me and my country. Brexit is happening and I see hope and prosperity for myself and for my fellow British citizens
1	Love Europe, hate the EU. A bright future awaits us. Thank you Nigel Farage.
0	skin crawls thinking of all the brexit celebration parties that’ll be happening tonight. I imagine the hosts being the kinda people who will serve their guests tinned sardines and congealed prawn finger sandwiches. a compilation of boyzone and oasis covers plays in the background
0	The irony of the brexiters celebrating being free of "unelected bureaucrats" by signing God Save The Queen is astounding #brexit
0	Brexit is a national embarrassment, The UK has become a laughing stock.
0	Oh how very kind of them, that's lovely, they're so nice after we've messed up so badly by deciding to leave, such gracious masters.
0	I never thought Brits could be so crass.
0	It's a very clever idea, because that means you always have an excuse for the disastrous effects. They've moved their claims to be completely outside of scrutiny. I actually do feel sorry for this guy, as stupid as he was for supporting Brexit. He's had his mind poisoned by the most filthy, opportunistic liars and ended up losing everything.
0	Surely we should now all work to damage the UK’s economic prospects as much as possible and force it to re-apply for entry to the EU to save itself?
0	I thought the leavers thought it undemocratic to keep voting on something until you get the result you want?  Odd.
0	What opportunities ? We having nothing to gain from leaving the EU, something Hague has always said. The more important question is why is Hague lying in this article ?
1	Out we have survived bigger events in our history it will hurt a lot of company’s and job equally a he’ll of a lot of people will benefit and the public services will get better
0	The Brexit Starzi. Be afraid..be very afraid. Unelected but trusted by an unstable liar of epic proportions to run the country.
1	HAPPY INDEPENDENCE DAY BRITAIN!
0	The worst part of this is the complete lack of rational logic-based debate in politics, all replaced by vacuous slogans, lies and scaremongering. Brexit has taken on a cult-like status, to be dogmatically believed regardless of cost. Something like the flat earth society or creationism springs to mind... No basis in common sense or logical thought..
0	The British are well-known for their conservative values as well as the pride of who they are.
0	It's the first day of your nightmare british people.
0	We all know the main reason of the break-up is the immigration chrisis, just stop hiding this from the media and say it out loud
1	and staying in will see us bled by EU commissars
0	The rest of the EU should remember, if it wasn't for the UK all of Europe would be speaking German now
0	To be honest I am looking forward to the bumbling #JohnsonTheLiar to have his interview with the attack dog #AndrewNeil. He shouldn't be on the @bbc he is very #rightwing very #probrexit not even slightly balanced Barclay Brother poodle #warmonger #climatechangedenier
0	Pelosi tearing up Trump’s speech at the end really encapsulates the left’s problem all over the world.
1	Am right behind you Boris , love your determination even after this past week !!
0	It's unbelievable this Friday the UK will leave the EU because of 1,269,501 votes. What's even more disturbing is the less than 70% voter turnout in the remain areas of England vs the 70% and over turnout in areas that voted leave. Most remain areas like Liverpool, Manchester, and London with massive populations had only 65% - 68% turnout. How different things would be with an extra 5% - 10% remain voter support. All the EPL clubs voted remain along with the financial center of the entire island yet no intelligent concession was made for these sectors that provide 80% of the UK GDP. Something is seriously wrong with Westminster and I completely understand Scotland's necessity to look out for its own future.
0	It’s at this point, now that it’s too late, that Brexiters finally realise that those charged with driving the bus to the sun lit uplands are all asleep at the wheel.
1	Have a Great EX-EU free Day
0	Scotland twice returned a majority of anti-Brexit MPs to Westminster who voted against Brexit at every turn. Now Scotland’s out of the EU. This isn’t a union.
0	Britain will ban sales of new gasoline and diesel cars from five years earlier than planned
1	I get the feeling that the Remtards still don't realise that they have lost and that we are actually leaving the corrupt Ponzi scheme that is the EU.  We need a grand gesture to make them aware of what losers they are and something that will keep reminding them.  I think a knighthood for Nigel Farage would do the trick
0	Of course Brexit means that something is wrong in Europe. But Brexit means also that something was wrong in Britain.
1	Congrats to the UK...a special time for the UK
1	The EU has already sown the seeds of its own demise by expanding too fast, and not even applying its own terms and conditions to new members - it all goes through with a wink and a nod.
0	They are separating from EU and creating more integrated ties with the US
0	We will then celebrate entering into a transition phase where we have to abide by EU law without any say and presently not having any trade agreements with even one of the 10 largest economies in the world. Laughing stock
1	Sovereignty!!!!! Before alleged wealth. Good for Britain!
0	All of this because millions of idiots hate seeing brown faces
0	I’m embarrassed and ashamed to be english today! After seeing the respect given to us by Europe for leaving the EU then seeing the uneducated, immature white trash of the uk celebrating and gloating that we “have our freedom” that don’t have a clue what it means.
0	Wait... Brits were celebrating driving their economy off a cliff?
0	Yes I am very European, always have been always will be
1	My word, how did we manage for over a thousand years without being in a  union with other European nations? I guess we just bimbled along... Come  on people we are the UK! We've been through ups and downs, highs and  lows and have always pulled back! Stop being milksop wimps and unite  together! PC, socialism and centrism have really weakened our nation!
1	WE do not need immigration .  We have enough british citizens to do the jobs, or train them.  And we already have rules and checks.  get real!
1	Tried to take our country. FAILED.
1	Ahhh our friends spreading their love. They should fk off. They destroyed out fishing coasts, families and businesses and turned them almost non-existent. Our waters- and it's non-negotiable
0	So they've left? Even though they're still paying dues & following the rules for another year while working out a trade deal? How exactly is that leaving again?
1	It isn't goodbye, it is hello from an independent UK.
0	Safeguarding peace and stability on the island of Ireland, protection of citizens and EU’s legal order has to be the main focus of any deal,” it said in a statement. “The UK proposals do not match even remotely what was agreed as a sufficient compromise in the backstop.
1	I say leave and get it over with. The majority (no matter how slim) voted to leave. So leave. Put on your boots and walk out. It's your country at stake you should worry about, not the rest of Europe.
0	Poor little Britain, sat sulking in the corner. No longer great, and soon no longer Britain, but only England and N Ireland, with Scotland and (probably) Wales gone from the Union. What have you fools done to yourselves?
0	May god have mercy on our souls.
1	We are a power house without the EU. More powerful than the EU. The EU makes nation states weaker
0	Give it up. It's a bad deal. After they first voted on the referendum, what was it 3 years ago, most people now think it was the wrong thing to do and they are against it.
0	Late to the party, but I might as well comment.  I think that both campaigns have been a joke, media reporting of  campaigns has been a joke, the fact we're having the referendum in the  first place is a joke, and that if we leave we will just be poorer but  nothing will really change.  For the record I'm a firm remainer, and I would vote to remain even  if there was evidence that we would be better off out, because i believe  in a united europe. I had an ERASMUS year, most of my friends are  europeans living all over the continent, I travel regularly around  europe and i intend to work in europe in the future if i get the  opportunity. The only thing thhat really separates the people of europe  is language. We all have similar cultures and similar values, and i  can't understand this 'us and them' situation that has arisen over the  past 10 years.  The media have been shown to be very much supporting brexit, whilst  pretending to be impartial to an extent. This is no surprise considering  that Rupert Murdoch has previously said he wants out of the EU as it  will give him more influence in government. What strikes me most about  media coverage is that there has been no effort to explain the  PROPORTIONALITY of anything this campaign. - When THIRTEEN nobel prize winners said we should remain, the same  amount of coverage was given to the ONE who said we should leave. - When a COMPANY (i.e. the board) in Rolls Royce say we should remain as  it would benefit their employees etc, the same coverage is given to an  individual in the owner of JCB saying we should leave as it would  benefit him. - When the misleading figure of '£350m a day' is banded about  constantly, there is no mention that this equates to just 0.5% of GDP.  The leave campaign has repeatedly talked about europe being run 'for  the elites', and everyone just seems to believe it, but if you look at  the prominent brexit supporters and campaign funders, they are all  extremely wealthy people with vested interests in leaving. they are  quite literally the elites trying to deceive britons for their own  personal gain. Shall we look at the people fronting the brexit campaign  whilst we're at it, and see how they are trying to help the people of  britain? - Michael Gove - Incompetent ex-education secretary, whose ideas whilst  in office were so offensive to the teaching profession that he caused  them to strike several times before losing his job. Doing equally well  as justice secretary. He wants to leave because his dad lost his fishing  job when we joined the EU. - Boris Johnson - Holds extremely right wing views, and whilst appearing  to be a bumbling loveable buffoon, is actually extremely intelligent  and dangerous. During his time as london mayor he accomplished nothing  except to make london less accessible to poorer people, and ignore  legislation in order to benefit wealthy property developers. He wants to  leave in the hope that David cameron is forced to resign so he can  become prime minister. - Nigel Farage - A man who openly encourages fear of foreigners (see  UKIP's latest poster) and repeatedly misleads the public. During his  time in brussels his party has actively voted against laws that would  directly benefit the people of this country, or just not voted at  all.... and he talks about democracy.  The only reason we're having this referendum is because Cameron was  scared he might lose supporters to UKIP in the general election. They  narrowly won a majority with 30% of the vote (democracy again eh). He is  quite frankly a fucking idiot who has created a split in the people of  this country for no reason.   At the end of the day, every negative the leave campaign give about  the eu, or that people think will be improved by leaving the EU, has  been caused by government policy rather than 'immigrants', 'unelected  bureaucrats' (they are elected) or any of the other bullshit excuses  being trotted out. Austerity has harmed the population of this country  far more than the EU ever has.  There's plenty more i can say, but i think that will do for now. haven't even mentioned the actual content of the campaigns
0	What Michael Gove isn't telling you is , England doesn't have 200 miles of "economic zonal waters " off Dover you have 7.9 miles . Off Northumberland you have 170 miles . Off The Scilly Isles you do , but it's only 25 miles wide at 200 miles
1	Brexit for the win, bollocks to the EU 🇪🇺 globalist elite
1	At last we can move forward. Today is not about leaving Europe it’s about not being governed by Europe
0	In my opinion, it's amazing that the EU is allowing us such a reasonable deal. You'd think that they wouldn't want to be perceived as giving us a better deal so that other countries won't leave, so if we don't take advantage of this great opportunity, I'll be amazed! With that offer, there's easily enough time to conclude an agreement, but I get the feeling that it won't be as easy as that. It really is sad to let them go.
1	Truthfully the UK no longer matter. it is not a power anymore. It is controlled by puppets in the shadows
1	Great Britain has the whole world to trade with.
0	I'm scared were going to actually end up out of the EU... do people actually understand what will happen if we leave?
0	Farage is a liar! He lied to people just to win the referendum!... such a bad person...
1	Can someone explain to me how they can cancel something that was voted to happen. Seems like it’s going against democracy
1	Michael Farage. The hero! Greetings from another EU country
0	UK leaves the most wealthy club on the globe to keep the lowest life of standard.I hope that I am wrong
1	I don’t have a strong opinion. I don’t educate myself on everything else going on in the world. It’s their right to leave, and I hope it works out for everyone.  Edit: I’m definitely rooting for the UK, and would love to see us become even stronger allies.
0	Leaving the EU would be a massive leap into uncertainty. The UK and other disaffected members have to make it work. We are not the United states of Europe, we have to stop those who are trying to turn us into one.
1	Among working-class voters, Boris has an amazing 44 to 17 per cent lead over Jeremy Corbyn. No wonder Labour strategists are so dismayed by the prospect of an election.
1	See remainers, the world didn't collapse, it was all project fear
1	Dom Cummings turned out to be a genius after all - and got what he and 17.4m wanted. Without him and Farage, none of this would have been possible
0	There is a lot you can do as united but not lonely
0	I don't see any facts, all I see is blind patriotism and Toxcity.
0	Anything that reduces the cohesiveness of the European project is  something that the Russians have been pursuing.  It is a divide and  conquer strategy that they are implementing.  The people in the EC are  only now getting around to figuring it out, too little too late.
1	Please what advantages of staying in? losing jobs is a myth so don’t tell me lies about that one, we have always been able to go and live and holiday abroad so that wouldn’t change. There is nothing but debt austerity and foreign criminals being allowed while we suffer.
1	"thank God we left" Now 30 million blacks and arabs just cant waltz in to get free public housing. Thank God
1	Free at last, free at last, praise God almighty they're free at last!
0	waiting for the super Gonorrhea
0	Honestly, I really don't think brexit will solve any of the problems the UK faces. We will still have a useless government, non EU immigration policy will remain the same, the forgotten corners of the UK will remain ignored by the UK
1	The UK is such a lil bi/tch and will pray and obey the EU like a lil bi/tch should. Hshaha
1	ten years time we'll look back on these last three years and wonder what all the fuss and panic was about.
1	Vote Leave!
0	A national disaster for which you bear the primary responsibility. Your name will be reviled for decades to come.
0	It could begin the unraveling of the EU all together.
1	These so many dislikes by people from EU members.
1	Finally the Brexit is happening. Took long enough but finally UK is leaving the EU. Of course there some deal to make and there is a transition period that will last 11 month's (+year if they agree for longer transition period) but finally the endless nightmare of constant delays are finally over.
1	So where’s everyone from?? And who will be attending any of the #probrexit rally’s in the lead up to and possibly after we should have left?  Im contemplating Boston (where I used to live & the largest VOTE #LEAVE in uk) or travelling to London on 2nd Nov if we haven’t left.
1	Instead of being so condescending and childish, work on building our future positively.  Stop giving Brexit a bad name.
0	I hope EU dont accepts any comprehensive deal with UK. Otherwise other countries in the EU will think they can do the same. Actually EU has to make their life miserable:) Now UK and their people can live their dreams without EU :)
0	Because stupid people, old people and racists vote too. Same problem in the USA. And Putin laughs.
0	They will reach a trade deal, very late in the day, when German Industrial Muscle gets Barnier replaced by someone who puts jobs before the European Project and the particular interests of French fishermen.
0	A sad day for all. My condolences to the future of the UK.
1	Remainers like telling everyone what to do.
1	Congratulations Great Britain 🇬🇧.  Never let some far off unelected body make rules that control your life.
1	The EU over steps and forces the countries to take on laws that have been suicidal towards to people.
1	Frankly I prefer to be dictated to & ruled over by people of my own country than foreign ones. That's Brexit in a nutshell & why I voted to Leave the EU.
0	The day that lies and manipulation won over truth.
1	Crowds were gathered at Calais to bid a sad farewell to Britain before Boris Johnson pulled up the colossal anchor which has been holding the islands firmly in place for thousands of years. It was a clear morning as the gigantic, barnacle encrusted mass of iron was hoisted above the water for all to see. Rivers of tears were shed as masses of EU onlookers watched the British Isles begin to slowly float away from the European continent. This is a truly astonishing day.
1	Former top judge calls for fundamental review of politics post- Brexit.
0	When I hear people talk about piecemeal, it sounds a bit like cake and eat
0	One nation conservatisme is morphing more and more towards ein Volk, ein Führer. When will the first statues of Enoch Powell and Oswald Mosley be erected?
0	Well no, Dear Leader Hegemon. You are not the determinant or repository of the will of the people, still less their evidence-based opinions. In this case, since the people involved have been found ’not to be serious criminals’ and to have served any sentences due them, your proposed deportation plan represents your shameful misrepresentation of the facts. Don’t listen to this fool if you want to retain any personal integrity.
0	If the Labor Party wasn’t led by a colorless incompetent and the Liberal party was’t lead by another boring incompetent, these two parties could have joined forces to build strong support to stay in the EU.   In their ineptitude, they actually colluded with Johnson and his fellow Brexiters. Unfortunately, the Democrats like the two “opposition” British parties may be put up a candidate who will allow the sociopath to continue his autocratic reign.
0	Absolutely nothing to celebrate. Brexit is an appalling act of national self harm. I am absolutely devastated to have had my EU citizenship stripped away through no fault of my own.
1	To all the uniformed people making accusations that Britain cannot make up its mind what it wants, they did decide something clearly. It was the EU who roundly rejected it cos they are playing hardball. They voted with a majority for the Brady amendment which means the withdrawal agreement but with a unilateral exit mechanism four the backstop. A reasonable caveat in a post colonial world. EU said no as they have done for two years. What you are seeing now is not the UK being unable to make up it's mind what it wants. It is the UK being unable to accept the vassalage from the EU. History will judge this moment very differently to how most of you nitwits are reading it.
0	It's time  to #Brejoin!
1	When one looks at the damage caused to the UK economy by the EU we are well off out. Grants co Cadbury's owners to relocate a factory to Poland ,over fishing of our waters. Aid for Valeo and Twinings to establish operations in East Europe are reported in the FT
1	Empires come and Empires go, goodbye EU
0	Their economy will suffer massively.
1	Well done Boris!
1	This Buffoon is only good at talking and rarely stick to his words.
1	Leave, there is a little benefit to staying in and Brussels has shown  they don't give a fuck about compromises. Only sensible option if you  actually want to help our country.
0	Because many multinationals set up in Britain because we offered access to the Single Market. Leave the Single Market, and you take away that reason for these companies to stay.
1	The Eurosceptic mission will not be over until the EU withers away. Brexit is just the first step
0	I think we will regret leaving the EU, good on Scotland for keeping the EU flag flying. You go go for independence, good luck to you as a country with foresight and common sense,
0	I will be 100% honest with you, if the UK vote leave on Thursday I will be ashamed to call myself British, I will have no option but to apply for my Finnish passport as I would feel sickened if I had to tell people I was British.
0	The UK has now become like a really aggressive panhandler outside a liquor store...one can only pity the delusions of grandeur and persecution that drove them to this sorry state...  You can "ask" for whatever deal you want...Canada..Australia...Timbuctoo style deal ...you'll get what the EU decides is in its interest ....
0	Soon, people who voted for BREXIT will realize how much more difficult they have made it for themselves and others.
1	I have been in business for more than 30 years..if my most important customer requested better trading terms .. then we would listen...and discuss in an open manner....however the European bunch are devoid of common business sense....we learnt many years ago ...the art of negotiation is silence.....its an all time winner Boris...we do have it.. the Euros .. do not....use it.. It works.
1	Left the sinking ship just in time, more to follow.
1	Personally, as a true liberal, I voted leave because I believe a smaller governing body is better for the people as they are more effective for the smaller amount of people they serve. An unelected closed off group of people, shouldn't be able to dictate laws to 28 different countries. I don't feel that the same laws would be effective in two culturally diverse countries.
1	Oh the euphoria.
1	Dump NATO and start the anglosphere
1	The EU cannot imagine life without controlling us in some way.  WE however can live without their interfering and bullying.  We're out!
1	I believe in democracy so we must accept the result and implement Brexit.
1	Of course we should the EU is more corrupt than FIFA.The EU after 20 years have still not had their accounts signed off.
1	As any good student of #Geopolitics knows, words matter - and they matter because they are moulded, managed, and manipulate
1	Brexit makes us a fully autonomous nation free of EU regulations and EU parliamentary decisions. Ensuring that when we vote for a law it can't be overturned by EU parliament. We're ensuring that we remain free of an EU super-state that aims to control everyone. We aim to keep free of a failing currency and economy and we are returning to our former glory of a nation that demands respect not laughed at and controlled by Brussels. We are ensuring that comrade Corbyn can't give our nation away.
1	I used to work for the EU. Italy was one of the founder members, having joined on 1 January 1958. As of the year 2000, Italy had never once 'implemented' an EU Directive (the process by which member states convert the Directive into their local legal system).
0	The maps will be drawn by the Donald, no fear.
0	Gooooood for you..... the old xenophobic Brits chose to be alone.... it wont last... the young want globalization over nationalism, and we are the future.
0	The irony, of course, is that those who will be most negatively affected by Brexit - without mobility, wealth, or truly valuable skills - are the ones who most ardently pursued it.
0	Brexit is not gonna happen! This is a comedy show!
0	We'll be the 51st state of the United States when Boris Johnson will shift job from Prime Minister to Governor or the British Isles, 85% of land designated for Trump's new golf developments, 5% for concentration camps, and thos lucky enough to be all camped up in Jaywick waving little union jack flags to the melifluous sounds of Farage
1	Thank you Boris Johnson and your government.  Our nation will over the long term be wealthier as an independent, free trading one.
1	I believe everyone has accepted that the eu is a failed project,  with the exception of a few brainwashed remoaner thicko's.
0	Ya'll know, our should have known, how stupid it was.
0	It's the single most dumb thing you could do
0	Best thing education did for me was to make me realize how uneducated I was about a vast majority of things.  I don’t want someone as smart as I am to be in charge. I want someone far more intelligent to be in charge.  Trump and Johnson seem far less intelligent than I, and I don’t know shit about international politics.  I do know shooting ourselves in the economic dick is a bad idea, though.
0	I hope that Scotland and Northern Ireland will leave the Union and that the people of England and Wales are faced with severe hardships as a result of this stupid move.
1	So far EU is behaving tyrannical, and it is to the detriment of EU
0	Don't really expect anything less from anybody who voted brexit, you're all morons.
1	The EU was supposed to be nothing more than a group of countries joined together with the single purpose of trade & all 28 members have an equal say, with none more powerful than the other. It turned out to be a German dictatorship ruled with an ethic of fear & retribution along with a fully blown political land grab. Germany quite openly dictates to its members now "you do as we demand or else we will punish you!". That's a dictatorship in anyone's language!. Let's get gone.
0	So when will we start to reap the benefits of brexit? When will I earn more money? when will the things my taxes go towards be ran better? when will the NHS be funded effectively? Or is it just a new passport? and the opportunity to overfish the channel?
1	Britain should “regain control” of its borders.
0	Now charity begin at home
1	No self-promoting politician should be a reason for anyone to be stripped of their freedoms.
0	I though that #Brexit was going to mean more control of borders. Now it turns out that #Brexit will be less control of our borders and a security risk. #PeoplesVote
1	Yes we need to get out we will save billions that can be spent here
0	How anyone still sticks up for Brexit is baffling.
0	So the UK goes from being a second rate power but part of a very important European Union, to being isolated and totally irrelevant in the modern word. But frankly, my dear, who cares!
1	Sometimes you hear story’s about failure being rewarded well Germany is typical. They seem to have more clout than anybody so yes out
1	The sadness of the speakers is delicious. Congrats on your freedom, UK!
0	No, Britain is a strong European nation and we need everyone in the EU. There is power in unity!!!
1	Happy Independence Day!! :) Here's hoping for a clean break Brexit.
1	it's not about immigration it's about being controlled by people who have no interest in this country whatsoever
0	Congratulations.  You just locked yourself in a tiny  island,  say Goodby to getting retired or study or work freely in 27 countries.  !!!!!
1	We should just leave then start to make deals
1	Congratulations!!!  Making Britain "Great" again!  It's all about national sovereignty, self-determination, and patriotism!  BEST WISHES FROM THE UNITED STATES of AMERICA!!
1	The EU is a George Soro's puppet. The plan is destroy the sovereignty of European countries and create a single and centralized government, so they can pass laws valid for all member countries without even having popular approval, which is already happening today, but on a smaller scale.
0	Maybe Brexit supporters (particularly the xenophobic ones) should be the new farm laborers. After all, don't xenophobes complain about foreigners taking jobs? Then why don't they work those precious jobs?
0	I can hear fireworks. The stupidity of this country is unreal.
0	Funny how Brexiters always talk about fishing and never about farming and agriculture once we come out of the transition we are now in.
0	to break up the EU it may have to be the breakup of the UK. This is the ultimate price british voters paid with the referendum
1	Take back your sovereignty Britain! VOTE LEAVE
1	Reduced to the most basics, Brexit was a fight between the mobile, and well off (who profited from being in the EU) vs the less mobile, not well off (who lost out to e.g. Polish plumbers) To see the data for yourself click below to see Fig 1 https://blogsmedia.lse.ac.uk/blogs.dir/107/files/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-13-at-8.33.47-PM.png The caption is, quote "Figure 1 shows the pattern highlighted by other analysts: people in households with incomes over £50,000 were substantially more likely to vote for Remain, and the opposite can be observed in people whose households are at the other end of the income distribution, especially those around £10,000" The more well of now mourn, the less well off celebrate -- LSE is the London School of Economics
0	Don’t hold your breath. The true effects of Brexit are waiting down the road. Promises will soon become more vague and problems will be laid at the door of the E U. Having conned people that the E.U. has caused all our problems they will now have face the consequences. Can’t wait to see where all this money is going to come from to replace EU grants with a government that wants to lower taxes. Huge conn.
1	I will vote to leave the EU. The happiest and most prosperous countries  in Europe are Switzerland and Norway; non EU countries. Britain retains  the pound and drives on the left.   Britain had to sever Commonwealth ties to join the EU.   Britain must set aside EU constraints to nurture old and new ties with other countries of the World.
0	The rise of the European Union 🇪🇺
0	Brexit is nothing more than a "big scam" which, the newspaper predicts, will fail, because it will not bring the promised welfare.
1	The EU is NOT a democracy
0	Say bye to free trade
1	Who cares what Boris does as long as he helps us get out of the bloody EU, one man's career pales into insignificance when compared to the vital issue of our place in Europe, make no mistake Europe is heading into the abyss, don't let it drag us there with it...vote out!
1	Brexit is like going on a rollercoaster for the very first time. Exciting and a bit scary. It's one hell of a ride but afterwards you are so glad you did it.
1	We won’t leave Europe it’s a geographical. We do need to leave a controlling political entity that has no true democratic process.
1	Go Boris! Stand your ground!! We the Britush People' back you!
1	DEMOCRACY WINS IN THE U.K!!
0	UK PM Boris Johnson tells "juvenile anti-Americans" to "grow up and get a grip", as he sets out his vision for increased UK-US trade post-Brexit, adding "the NHS is not on the table" during negotiations
0	Sad day for EU ( no more money from UK)
1	It is easy to make threats when you're hiding behind somebody else.  Barnier thinks the EU has far more global power than it actually does
0	Why are UK citizens blaming the EU for their local austerities? That is muddle-headed. Expressing anger is fruitless unless it lands on the people with the power to do something about the problem. The EU doesn't tear down rotten buildings in a small town. The EU doesn't build playgrounds or see that the grass in parks is mowed. That isn't its function.   People can control their government using intelligent activism, starting at the local level. If the people elected to power aren't doing the job, consider choosing another.  Grousing is for releasing pent up anger and frustration but positive change needs method, committment and steady command of the facts. Local problems start with local solutions. Seek the change you desire from your community, your friends, your family and yourself. Organize, identify goals and then pursue the means together.   Before leaving a trade agreement that delivered prosperity, citizens need to know explicitly what they will lose, what they will gain, and how they will mitigate the negatives when they occur.   People have to do this on the mundane level every day, and it is called 'common sense' or 'being practical' or 'thinking things through'.
1	"If you do not follow the rules, we shall silence you."   - The EU  Speaks volumes.  It is a corrupt political totalitarian entity, it seeks to destroy nations through threats.  Good riddance.
1	I think it's a positive process that's going to work out for the UK.
1	congratulations
1	We’re leaving!!! Yes!!!! Bottle of champagne on 31/01
0	Honestly, this already took so long and now it’s gonna take at least another year for a trade deal? What a major waste of time.
1	Why a modern country should stay together with some others that have different cultures and languages.
1	I'm a UK citizen but have lived in Canada for 10 years. I have dual  citizenship and never intend on returning to live or work in the UK or  Europe. I am on the side of Leave, for one reason.  The EU makes a  mockery of democracy, I would not want anyone to live in a society where  laws are created by those who are unelected, which is exactly what  happens in the EU. I agree with EU policies most of the time, however if  I did not there would be no recourse. It smacks of a system that is  just waiting to be abused.  Because of the way I lean on this issue I did not mail-in vote, I  think it would be pretty rich for someone who is against people outside  of a country telling it how to be run, to then vote in an election in a  country I do not live it.  I am glad that the conversation regarding the EU is taking place,  however the UK has a bad reputation with having hilariously close  referendums, and then simply ignoring the issue from then on out. "We've  already had a referendum, what more do you want?"  Thanks for reading.
0	Every day we let this Brexit mess go on means less money being invested in the UK, fewer jobs being created and less tax revenue to pay for our public services.
0	Since when did brexiteers think about the economy? This is all about, following their xenephobic fantasies and building a hard Irish border so we can return to 70s and 80s with IRA car bombs.
1	There's the egregious EU copyright directive, which will stifle freedom of speech, and the UK is not going to implement it.
0	I’ve had the great fortune in my life to have huge flexibility to live abroad in the EU and experience new cultures. Today is a sad day for me as such opportunities going forward for others will now be more limited. I find that a shame as that’s how I’ve grown the most. #brexit
1	Now let's get a good deal, UK an Island, a trade agreement with EU, make our own rules
1	Thats what happens when UNELECTED LEADERS who know nothing of the plight and condition of their people force upon them a union that lambast and spits upon their national heritage.
0	To all the Remainers, I’m sorry too loose you from our big family, You are always welcome.  To all the Brexiters. You are resented and pretty much hated by everyone in the 27 member states. You talk about Independence Day, and Freedom like you have fought off a occupying force. You have insulted every single country inside the EU, I own a Business that have suppliers and Customers all over the EU. If any of my suppliers or customers have acted like most Brexiters. I will cancel everything with that customer or Supplier. And Yes if you are wondering it is remarkable easy to tracking people’s online activity!  Brexiters, Stay on your Island! You are seriously not welcome!
0	I was just discussing with a leaver in another forum how curtailing freedom of movement would adversely affect my family’s lives. He simply did not get it. His eventual position was that he couldn’t afford foreign holidays anyway so nobody else should have one, ever, but mainly he wanted Romanians to all go home. It’s like arguing with a paper bag, honestly. But what was abundantly clear was that it was all abut him.  All his points were totally self-serving, and devoid of any empathy for the consequences anyone else might have to suffer. This is why I don’t like leavers.
1	Aussies wish you all the best in your decision to leave. Hope it is all that you wish it to be.
1	Congratulations UK! America is with you. You are our sister and we only want you to rise back to the wonderful country my wife and I love so much.
1	I don't think the Brexiteers will enjoy watching you pee all over them and their piece of shit parade, Joris. Well some of them might... but only on a Saturday night
1	Welcome back to the club of free nations Britain. We missed you.
1	Globalist are enemy of the people
0	Do I think that the EU is a fantastic institution? No. But I think that the handling of Brexit has been a farce. All the lies that were revealed, and no-one is accountable. All the people at the top jumped ship leaving us with an unelected PM, and an incompetent brexit team. More than anything I wish there was some accountability for the bs propaganda machine, and I feel like a mug for wanting to believe the promises.
0	I’d much prefer you embraced a starving rabid polar bear instead.
1	next should be a swexit
0	The currency falls to its lowest since the 80s. But hey, change is good...
0	Can't wait for food prices to rise
0	They know #Brexit will be a huge failure, but if the EU collapses they can then say we were right to leave anyway. They want the UK and the EU to fail. It will please their paymasters - Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump.
0	Now seeing this. i see how many stupid people the UK haves. dont know anything and there are only old people talking. bye UK good luck you will lose a lot
0	Our leaders and the politicians are the REAL rubbish.
1	Wow the alternative intro to V For Vendetta looks great
1	MAKE GREAT BRITAIN GREAT AGAIN
0	Big mistake
1	The Tory’s have a lot to answer for, they have destroyed every day life as we know it, look what they have done, people are sleeping in doorways, people drinking in the streets, a lot of people can’t speak properly so they take to swearing all the time, they spout dirty foul language and it’s not just young people doing it, it is clear what is happening in today’s modern life, if that is what you call it, in seems like this country is going backwards instead of forwards, caused I feel by too many people in this country, yes it’s called over population, both the Tory’s and labour have severely damaged Britain, both have let immigration spiral out of control, vote to leave, i can’t see no other way out of this problem.
0	The people who run this ‘United Kingdom’ do not represent all of us. I’m sorry for their behaviour, I wish we could continue to be in the EU. I’m a European at heart, they can’t take that away.
0	A Brexit deal could take ten years. That's not fair. Most of the people who voted for it could be dead by then.
0	What an absolute shambles this has become. ...We didn’t vote to leave, end of story just get on with it
0	It’s time to go back to the people and decide what they want to proceed with - they have seen the lies by politicians and have heard the disruption Brexit will cause. Let’s let them make a final decision.
1	LEGENDS!Asking True Brits  not to wave their national flag,  yea that will work lolðŸ’ªðŸ˜‚ðŸ‘Œ..ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§My brothers and sisters of Europe, watch your flag blow in the breeze and smile for its steeped in your history's struggles and achievements,  wave your flag with unshameful pride, recognise your individual cultural traditions and feel blessed ðŸ‘ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§
0	When it comes to something like Brexit, I am part of the liberal-media London bubble, and so, to me, voting to leave was madness.
1	Finally the wait is over.....🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
0	We will be weaker. We will be poorer.
1	"Fell on his sword"? Cameron could retire tomorrow and still have more money than most of us earn in a lifetime. Fell on his sofa, more like.
1	Brexit ensures that the money the UK previously sent to Brussels will be spent as the UK decides.
0	It’s utterly idiotic. I’m astonished how many people just don’t get why it’s a terrible idea.
1	Britian only wanted the Trade part of the EU not the whole one united country thing.
0	what a future is there, i'm lost
1	After Brexit, welcome coronavirus!
1	we can do better than now. Just like any other kind of relationship it needs compromises and development. Let's do this!
0	Britons left the EU and we Bosnians are still trying hard to join. Damn we're down
0	brexit is the worst possible thing for our country
1	Yes, britan should leave the E,U. Can’t afford to stay in with all this immigration and become a closed country
0	Brits will no longer have that right.  Brexit ended opportunities for Brits only.
0	The #BRAINDRAIN starts now. People all over the country who have intelligence and talent will be plotting their escape to one of the EU27. Where will you go?
1	Emotional ...... for those who are proud of Great Britain and know we won’t be downtrodden
1	Off sick today. I can watch Andrew Neil talking to Polly Toynbee or flip over to Jeremy Kyle. Tough choice. We are here because of the arogance of people who thought that they were better and cleverer than the people they were meant to represent.
1	Good job bypassing the corrupt @BBC - their coverage was a complete lie, not one shot across Parliament Square showing the celebrations.
0	When will you admit you’ve removed the rights of 60m UK citizens to live, work, study, retire in 30 countries?
1	EU want to extend to keep UK money coming in . It'll be over four years since the vote , ....we're leaving Dec.31st ......ready or not EU , it's bye bye .
0	Brexit day showed again there's so much ignorance and racism among Brexit supporters, even though we're told we're not allowed to say that to shut us up. Our job now is to work out how to combat it especially when Brexit and Tory rule will make ordinary people's lives much worse
1	Brexit now! Get back with the Commonwealth!
0	How low Britain has fallen - what a mess it is
1	I'm in Germany everyone I've spoken to here says they wish Germany would do the same
0	They don't have staff to fill the shelves in my local supermakets already. Whole sections are being left empty. Where are the British workers leave.eu promised?
0	Brexit is an ugly family heirloom that you secretly want to ‘lose’ in a fire but you’re too scared of offending your older relatives to admit it.
0	Successive UK governments exploited whatever loophole they could find, pumping untreated sewage into our seas until 1998 – longer than any other European country. Now they've started again. #Brexit
1	Let's just keep voting until we get what we want.
1	I think it is good the UK leaves as they were never that happy to be in the EU.
1	Brexit was won because of years of lies and anti EU propaganda from right wing UK newspapers and media.
1	I’m not sure if Brexit will be a success but today is, on balance, a good day for democracy and trust in politicians.
0	A very sad and embarrassing day to be British. The present UK will no doubt eventually rejoin the EU, no longer united and no longer a kingdom. But it's a heartbreaking day for young people who will now miss out on the benefits the boomers enjoyed. #BrexitDay
1	BRITISH ECONOMY TO BOOM THIS DECADE
1	Brexit <3
0	You always know when it's all going wrong. The PM decides to keep a low profile. He avoids scrutiny. He suppresses the truth. With #BorisJohnson, this has been the case since day one. But, it's getting worse, much worse. He's losing it. Downhill from here!
0	Bad idea awful execution
0	My condolences fellows.  May your shortages not be completely terrible
0	A sad day and a big mistake 😪
0	It's quite funny seeing some running from European Union, some are waiting to get into it.
0	Whatever you think of Brexit, it was utterly petulant and disgraceful for BBC to refuse to cover the PM's speech last night.
0	What happens? Nothing good. The UK is finished.
0	'we will be able to do what we want' - something tells me that won't be the case.
1	Yeyyyyyyyyyyyyyy Britain. Australia wants a Trade deal over a few beers. Congratulations on getting your freedom from the 4th Reich. Sink the EU.
1	Not only England is happy with Brexit, Germany is too. Germany had never wanted Britain in the EU. Now At long last Germany scceeded in kicking Britain out of the EU.
0	I never thought of it in the sense that the EU is essentially a safety check against disgusting governments like our current one and that EU funding does a lot, even for the disadvantaged. Neck, I feel the EU supports the poor of this country better than the actual government.
0	I suspect most of them don't really care what happens next and they are entirely unaccountable for their actions.
0	Politicians calling brexit “done” is a horrifying indictment into how little planning they have put in going forwards.
1	You have my vote Boris but if you win a majority and get Brexit done, please take a little advice from one of your voters - stay connected with the People - as you have done throughout your tour of the country during your campaign. Don’t become disconnected in London from them.
1	F* EU. Sorry I meant to say good by and best wishes to the EU.
0	Brexit is a scam
1	My personal opinion is leave. The way i have seen immigration be an  issue with places like germany and the likelihood of turkey becoming a  part of the EU and the large influx of immigration that would cause  would have a significant impact on the country. But that's a small  reason i want to leave. the main reason is people in this country don't  believe that we can be great they don't believe that we can stand on our  own and i think taking the risk of leaving would strengthen everyones  belief that we can be a great country once again who are significant in  their own right and can stand alone without needing the backup of others
0	Today I’m disappointed and sad. I’m scared for my generation’s future and generations to come.  Scientists receive so little funding from the UK we are very dependent on EU sources and collaboration. I won’t be surprised if over the coming years the UK’s output of original research falls because people, both European and British, choose to move and work elsewhere. I will likely be one of these people when I finish my PhD, I can’t imagine staying here where my work is not valued and every day is a fight to stay funded.  I’m also sad that people have managed to be persuaded by the at times less than savoury leave campaign. ‘X’ amount of money won’t be diverted back in to the NHS. We’ve seen enough money-based promises that the government fails to go through with to know that. It is going to be very costly to maintain a decent position within finance and trade with the rest of the world. Also, immigrants are just as responsible for this country’s successe. They have given so much and continue to do so. Mainly, as citizens of the world, how can we turn away from people who are just looking for a better life and block ourselves off from the outside world?
1	Lots of Brexit supporters are still complaining, about the EU, 'remoaners' and everything else
0	And Putin's hold on continental Europe grows.
1	Despite what the loony left media and a handful of quislings tell you, there is no major desire in the UK to stop brexit.
1	About time. The UK doesnt need to be bound up with the rest of Europe. They are doing fine and are one of the most sought after countries in Europe for job seekers....you don't see mass immigration of Brits to elsewhere....
0	We did what, goodbye Britain the final death knell has sounded
0	Boris' plan is to setup the Brexit for failure, call a general election and campaign on being the person trying to get it done.... but , EU, Parliment, etc were stopping him. Going to fail at that too.
1	It's a great day for Remoaners too. They're now all free to leave the UK, the country they hate so much !! Enjoy, won't you all. I'd like to say we'll miss your mewling, but the fact is, we won't. Bye.
0	one good thing with this is the decades old blame on migrants for every problem in this island will now cease.
1	Congratulations on regaining your independence and Sovereignty.
1	I thought it was going to boost support for independence in Scotland, but the polls haven't really shown that, which is disheartening. Maybe the exit will have to actually go through first. As it happens I'm going to be studying abroad at Edinburgh next semester, so I'll be right in the thick of it.
1	History remembers a time when the UK was a nation of explorers. Now it seems we're consumers of the crumbs from EU's table. #brexit #leave
0	Boris is behaving like a dictator. He fancies himself a Churchill, but he's a pale shadow. "Grow up" he says, I say he needs to look in the mirror. The worst PM in British history, a liar even by politician standards who only won an election by lying through his teeth and exploiting a broken system.
0	in the UK we currently enjoy the largest choice of products globally than any other country this maximises the end value to GDP contributions .Brexit will annihilate this. Soon we will only have Paprika flavoured crisps to choose from !!
0	Ha ha. Big Ben sounds like a death knell. 11 months to go until Brexit gets real. I'll make sure I have plenty of popcorn for that.
1	Congratulations to Britain for brexit .The wise old nation once again showed its might. Greetings from Finland.
1	I’m celebrating with our brethren across the pond tonight. What a great victory for Liberty! Cheers from America!
1	A wonderful day ! Great to hear Big Ben bong.
0	Johnson wants the benefits of a union but not the obligations. And do away with workers protections etc. while he‘s at it. Working for his business friends, not for the people
1	UK must be free of EU to regulate itself and trade around the globe
1	At last the road to freedom! Free from packaging regulations! Free from EU flight compensation rules! Free from data protection!
0	Britain is like the wife/husband who always says ‘I’m leaving,’ and talks about it constantly, and drags their feet. Now they arguing over who will get the house/kids/money/cars and dogs. And the kids are saying, ‘man who cares just stop fighting.’
0	People hate it because they haven't thought about the EU properly.
0	STOP BREXIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1	they should do so the sooner the better. There is no need for a burden to the further European integration
0	Brexit is finished. We the people have spoken. We shall remain.
0	Absolute chaos, London burns down, massive civil war, a dictatorship will be formed under rule of the monster raving loony party, uk renamed, Union Jack will have a goose on it and cats will be mauling people on the streets
1	To all fellow Brits, this is a day to celebrate. With special thanks to 17.4m and the ⁦ @Telegraph ⁩ who kept the battle alive for #BrexitDay. ⁦
1	UK will thrive and EU will collapse.  the only thing that can hold UK back is negativity. Boot out anyone who shows negativity and make our country GREAT again.
1	That's fair. I believe that there is potential for things to improve due to Brexit, such as a more equal and international trade relationship with the world. But there is the possibility that I was wrong and things won't get better. If it doesn't go well I'll hold my hands up and say I overestimated the power of the UK, but I still genuinely believe we are large enough and influential enough for this to be the success that it could be
1	Blame the capitalists for why people want socialism in and migrants out
1	The snowflake remoaners are holding vigils hahaha!!!! I'm absolutely loving it. They are in complete meltdown. The sinking eu ship will sink with all hands within 5 year's.
0	I find it embarrassing the level to which those without facts will stoop to rubbish the other side's argument.  There are precious few facts, and it's nowhere near clear cut one way  or the other.  I am therefore hoping voter apathy doesn't occur because  people really DO need to make their views heard, and I would expect a  higher turnout than at the general election.  Personally, i'm voting IN.  This is for a few reasons: 1) I'm a small  business owner, and those saying OUT either have large businesses that  would weather the impending economic storm or have no visibility of what  it would be.  Conversely I can see from our revenues the difference  between a confident and shaky economy, and it's scary wondering how i'm  going to pay my staff whilst this shakes out (if the Brexiters win).  2)  I have a non-EU wife, and the levels of PITA filling out Visa  applications when I want to visit her parents or vice versa is a massive  massive ballache, and I don't think the Brexiters have factored this  in.  3) Any side featuring Farage and Britain First needs to be  countered in any shape or form.  4) Boris's opposition is purely a PM  play.
0	Cutting off your nose to spite your face. Good job boomers, you sure showed us.
1	She knew what she was saying. Good riddance we are out of the EU, we will be much stronger without these leeches
0	UK is finished
0	It's kind of ironic that back in the day the usa celebrated its independence from the uk now some 244 years later things are reversed.the uk will celebrate its dependence to usa.
0	Not mentioned is environment. I fear for conservation funding and environmental legislation with Brexit.
1	i hope we have left the blood suckers hope there is no sneaky deal going on
0	I honestly hope all the people who supported this stupid nonsense never speak or vote again and basic common sense can return...
0	It seems so irresponsible that the BREXITEERS went to the British public with all kinds of promises, but they didn't have a PLAN for how to exit the EU. It has turned out to be a nightmare. where is Farage now? Where is Boris?
0	Johnson admits in public to being a sociopath. And I am unsurprised.
0	Journos moaning abt access have Already Forgotten Their Own coverage of Brexit, election... Bias. Lies More Bias More...
0	Whatever happened to sunlit uplands? Brexit food price rises and lost jobs are grim dangers that charlatan Boris Johnson conceals behind his Big Ben bong-kers farce.
1	good bye, and never come back, no one will miss you
0	Stand back and enjoy the shitshow. Then lob a few hand grenades in here and there just to make yourself feel better. You're welcome.
1	he EU had a good run but it has run it's course.
1	Congrats UK!
1	I felt that the UK’s membership in the EU was putting both her own citizens as well as non-EU foreigners in the UK at an unfair disadvantage against EU citizens
1	Such awesome news for our beautiful Great Britain....back to being independent again
0	It is a sad moment for Europe. I can' t understand why somebody can hate so much his european civilization, european heritage, european culture, european ancestors, to do this. Perhaps we can talk about poverty, analphabetism, lack of school, lack of facilities, lack of future facilities, unmotivational life. Very strange for a country so called european.
1	The EU is a crumbling mess, a 50's solution.
0	The trade deals seem to be a problem. The border between Ireland and Northern Ireland is another sticky situation. The whole thing doesn't seem like it was well thought out.
0	If this was truly supported by the country why isn't there a feeling of triumph, millions on the streets, street parties galore the red arrows, I'll tell you why... It's because this is a shit sandwich
1	Brexit is done. Celebrate. The world has become a better place. What a great atmosphere in Parliament Square...brilliant.
0	pathetic... i am saddened and embarrassed to be British
1	I voted Leave because I am a socialist Old Labour man.
0	Face it, front it, deal with it, we all know that Brexit is a massive mistake that will crash large parts of the UK economy.
0	Cant wait for Scotland to the same to not so really united kingdom.
1	The one thing that Europe isn’t is democratic, and that is the main reason that the UK wants out. We never were asked, and never wanted to join a Political Union, we asked to join a trading union.
0	This not going to end well...
0	I'm late to the thread but in case another opinion is still useful to you...  I'm a non-EU migrant to the Netherlands and was living in England in 2016 when the referendum results were announced. It was baffling to me - after the thousands of Euro and all the beauracratic hoops I had to jump through to obtain a residency permit, here is an entire European nation DELIBERATELY throwing away its people's EU citizenship rights!   Genuinely made me wonder how many voters had lived as non-EU citizens (i.e. been adults pre mid-70s) and if they had any idea that they could even vote for their MEP (as I can not without citizenship) let alone ever lobbied their MEP to make the changes they would like to see in the EU.   While I m aware of the flaws in the EU (the Eurozone is pretty questionable, and large chunks of the EU budget are often squandered) the principle is sound and the simple bliss of living in peace time cannot be easily dismissed.  My heart goes out to the destitute poor and working poor of the UK, it's been an ugly decade and will only get worse.
0	Brexit will end London's financial dominance.
0	So this basically means we're in all sorts of trouble. We have a PM using words like 'superhero' so that thick people can actually believe him. In modern Britain it is astonishing that people can be manipulated in this way.
1	They told Globalism to go to hell!  Good!
0	I would delete Donald Trump. I would delete Hillary Clinton. I would delete the man who was responsible for Brexit.
0	It is surprising how many of the Brexiteers have no clue which way up the union flag should be flown so I don't think they have much credibility in who ,why and how flags should be used.
0	some of the British still think that United Kingdom is still half the world sorry to tell u its only a dot on the map now and it hardly has anything to offer anyone in the world because we ain't the world anymore...
1	the money we spend is nothing compared to the loss of opportunities.
0	So Brexit day has finally come. It's a sad day for many, myself included. I still hope my country can find its way back, I don't know how long it'll take or how hard things will get, but I (and many others) will never give up on EU.
1	I am 100% behind you Boris. Keep going as our PM!
1	Staying in the EU would very likely lead to a long-term brain drain from the UK as non-EU graduates are treated as cash cows for the years of education they seek in the UK
1	I've got to see the Brexit process through. we won the war, but we must win the peace.
0	Most likely the UK will seek readmission into the EU in around 30-40 years time bloodied, bruised and humiliated. but hopefully the English will be more capable of treating europeans as equals and have a better sense of their standing in the world.
1	Britain has always punched above its weight fortunately for Europe.( Napoleon, Kaiser wilhelm, Adolf hitler ) we would rather die like lions to keep our culture our sovereignty and our freedom to being absorbed into an inefficient undemocratic top heavy club . No thanks .Remember you may need us again one day.
1	Isn't it great to be the out of the EU ?Like having escaped alive from a burning building, we can now watch as it self-destructs from a safe distance.
1	Simply leaving the EU means Brexit was successful. Mission accomplished.
1	Historically, this country has always done well by avoiding foreign entanglements. Brexit can only be for the good.   Also historically, our foreign policy was based on "balance of power" in Europe. We ensured no-one got too big. One has to wonder if our government-in-residence (the civil service) hasn't been still following this policy: our leaving now, with the EU at its weakest, will ensure that member countries will be at each others' throats over the budget shortfall.  The suggestion being true or not is irrelevant: this is a mortal blow for the EU - Nemesis in action - and even if the EU survives, it won't prosper. Without the UK, it simply doesn't generate enough to keep itself afloat: the Germans, rigorous as they are, can't do it all alone.
1	Eh? How does the EU keep it's cards to itself? Von der Leyen was apparently tweeting out that the UK would have to stick to EU standards for a trade deal. How is that keeping your cards close to your chest?
0	Anyone else feel like we are in the set up of another world war
0	If Britain wanted the same benefits as a member state, all you had to do was remaining a member state. No you're out and you'll NEVER have those benefits again.
1	remoaners cry into your marmite tonight,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
0	British do not come to Spain for vacations please, bye bye!
0	Are there any Brexiteers out there who went to see 1917? I have been put off because the writer and director said it was anti Brexit? Dunkirk was one of the worst films I have ever seen and the last Bond was poor. I don't want to waste my time on another bad picture.
1	Brilliantly amazing PM Boris Johnson! Thank you that we leave EU and got our sovereignty and independence now as UK start a new beginning our lives with no Marxist to dictation in Jesus name I pray! Amen
1	The real problem facing Eurotrolls in 'post-Brexit' Britain is the construction of a coherent sentence.
1	Wednesday 01/30/2020 After my friendship root with #Europianparliament  I would to amuse them, talk to them, to admit that they had a great powers is only the augment Christian adverts to the name of Prime Minister   #BorisJohnson  Who has Contributed so largely to the blossoming of #BritishEngland  And save the first sourses of the politic  truthhttps://thegreekobserver.com/greece/economy/article/34993/500-million-euro-covered-bond-issued-alpha-bank/
0	Brexit is a misguided attempt to turn back the clock to better times. Politicians are just parasites that will go in whatever direction offers them best benefits.
0	Our nation got sold out from under us, and a lot of people here in England very much wish they had the option to bail out.
0	the cost of Brexit equal the "savings" in contribution to the EU. Anyway the world economy as a system loses because there is no contribution to the EU and the UK economy is smaller. Everyone lose out.
1	Uk keep on going and Bye bye Bureocrats Globalists!
0	It is impossible for me, a well travelled, cosmopolitan, European to understand how so many people have been taken in by so many transparent lies. To comprehend how other intelligent individuals cannot see through the deceipt and the corruption.
1	Leave.  Because salmon smokers shouldn't have to label that their products "contain fish".
0	they didn't give a flying fish about the way they ruined UK fishing &amp; put hundreds out of work; so why the hell should we give
0	if u believe that migrants are simultaneously taking all our jobs AND sponging off the benefits system then you're a daft'un.
1	do you think the British people would have signed up for that shit ?? lets just pull the plug and fkem off down the road ,the 39/£40 billion will go a long way to get us back on our feet ,plus i dont like a Mcsnail burger anyway !
1	Well done  @BorisJohnson , will go down in history as one of the greatest PM's 👍👏🍻
0	As a nation, we just don't fancy you anymore, so if
0	Dear UK, Close your eyes and brace for economic impact...
0	England was fine when the British empire collapsed, and they will continue to be just fine. EU is nothing but a German Fourth Reich. Germany runs and control EU. ITALY will exit soon too.
1	Globalists are doomed .
0	Britain wil fall apart. Thanks to brexit. Scotland will be an independent European country.
1	The EU has destroyed Europe. It's sad! I'm glad Great Britain, the land of my ancestors, is going to leave. We might just do the same thing here in Texas.
1	Remainers made it clear a long time ago they never understood the concept of negotiating.
0	Sorry, the people did not vote for Boris Trump. He didn't get a majority of the votes.
1	We are leaving the sinking EU.
0	Brexit, its like the charge of the light brigade, Johnson is just a big dreamer.
0	I'm English.   I work in England for an British company, fitting Dutch made  materials onto German made vehicles for a German headquatered  multinational that is 75% owned by the French government.  My wife is an EU citizen.  My livelihood and family life depends on free trade and freedom of movement.  Remain.
1	Britains most idiotic self inflicted economic wound led by the most appropriate buffoon of a leader ....knock yourselves out Britain
0	31th of January for Europe is like 4th of July for America ...the day when we got rid of England :)))
0	I hope that Britain suffers royally from their decision to go through with Brexit.
1	we joined a golf club but now it's a tennis club
0	As an economics student, I can confidently say that almost everything  I've read from the leave campaign, at least from a financial  standpoint, has been a huge mistake at best, or at worst they are just  plain lying to the people. Add on the fact that we will need to keep  open borders if we want access to the single market, and I cannot see  any reasonable reason to vote leave. I'm not suggesting the remain  campaign have behaved entirely reasonably either, but many of their  claims have at least some evidence to back them up.  Edit: Should've figured this would strike a chord. I'm not claiming  to be an expert, just throwing my opinion out there, feel free to  disagree.  Edit 2: John Oliver has said it better than I can, I encourage you to watch the following video: https://youtu.be/iAgKHSNqxa8
0	UK came into EU with lots of misgivings and is now leaving it with even more misgivings!
1	Why did we ever join this corrupt empire in the first place?...
0	Britain has betrayed Europe.....never should have trusted them in the first place. Wish them all the luck on their island while it's floating far unto the ocean.
0	Now please let us leave the UK we dont wanna be there we didn't wanna leave the EU and we want our lands back and a future for out children 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
1	I do not understand how having sovereignty over your own soil can even be percieved as a negative thing?
1	Well done Leavers, we got our country back, now it’s up to us
1	Boris may have his faults and has turned his back on N Ireland but Brexit for the UK is the best thing at this stage.
0	Brexsterity looming in a few months will make austerity look like a boom.
0	In short there are no benefits to Brexit except for the rich getting richer. So if you're rich, yay you!
0	Well that idiot will bring the UK to the brink that much is sure
1	Good morning WW patriots! In my first post on twitter, I would like to say congrats to all our UK patriots on standing your ground with Brexit when it would have been soooo easy to roll over. #WWG1WGA
1	I am SO HAPPY that we are leaving. Against all odds we won our Democratic Vote. Next sort out the Civil Service to abide by Democratic Votes they tried everything to get us to remain. Don’t ever underestimate the British. THANK YOU NIGEL FARAGE I respect you and will never forget you. Get your knighthood and fight for our rights in The Lords we will need you there as you aren’t an MP which you should be
1	Just love it that the Remain side seem to be getting all nasty and spiteful, we are all human after all, were is the Love????? The sun backs Brexit and they all go crazy, it's quite entertaining VOTE LEAVE but do it nicely.........not like the Remain side
1	When Campbell says independence isn’t freedom lol
1	We do not owe or trust  the Merchants of greed, this is not about  the British brexit they fear, but  the aspirations of the rest of Europe, to free itself of a morally corrupt, and anti democratic EU.
0	I do not think that Boris Johnson can call the shots here.
0	I wish Great Britain all the best in spite of choosing Brexit! Good luck, friends!
0	#LiarJohnson and #Brexit have taken the British lion and knocked its teeth out. Now they are pulling its claws out, one by one. Soon it’ll be flayed...a rug for the kleptocrats and oligarchs to wipe their bespoke shoes on.
1	After Brexit, the United Kingdom will have greater control over its own industrial laws, and its significantly tighter borders following its separation from the European Free Movement  range mean fewer immigrants will enter the country.
0	Never really been able to comprehend the actual number of dumbfucks on this Island.  Nor the extent of the actual dumbfuckery.  Then I saw Parliament Sq on Friday night.  People celebrating 'Getting Brexit Done' because that's what Boris said.  There are fucking loads of idiots.
1	Once again the liberals refuse to obey the will of the people.
0	Well it's an impressive act of shooting oneself into the own foot on an epic scale.
1	That's the point, the EU benefited from the membership of the UK. However, the UK gained nothing from membership of the EU.
1	Congrats to Britain. This is YOUR independence now. Make the best of it.
1	Congratulations to UK!!!  You now have an Independence Day of your own!  =)
0	Brexit is like having a few complaints about your house so you burn it to the ground and then start thinking about how you might want to rebuild it
1	GB should leave the EC and face the fact that the threat of a financial crisis is now mainly concerning stronger economies and not the poorest countries that have nothing to lose anymore.
0	Boris Johnson is about to find out just how weak the UK is after Brexit. Britain small. EU massive.
1	Peace, Prosperity,  Freedom  Revolution ........All Hail to Boris - Make it Real Baby!!
1	UK imports to the EU are MUCH greater than imports. They are more reliant on us, so lets get out and decide our own future and also make the gravy that is needed.
0	I voted remain, was disappointed at the result, but over the past 3 and a half years became fed up with people who tried to subvert the democratic wishes of the majority.
1	The EU is a totalitarian, anti-democratic, anti-nationalist organization. It needs to be completely dissolved.
1	SO happy for Britain ! : ) Hope to see France and Italy and Hungary and Poland ESCAPE soon too.
1	The EU is titanic, it has already hit the iceberg. The UK are the first people into the lifeboats. We have rowed away and awaiting rescue. While the EU is rearranging the deck chairs in the dark.
1	You can embrace to your hearts content BUT I will never embrace lies corruption and your governments wish to commit
0	Brexit was like the UK got drunk and accidentally unfriended Europe on Facebook
1	I voted leave with sadness, the EU could have been a great thing. The politicians behind the EU have turned it into an institution with limited goals - the preservation of the EU and long term federalism.They stopped listening to the concerns of the people a long time ago.I wish our European friends well but I fear now we have left the EU will become increasingly insular and will stagnate.
0	Great Britain will soon be no more, the fragmentation has already started and eventually lonely England will be assimilated as a new state of the USA.
1	So nice to be in control of our own destiny.
1	What’s up with libs thinking they can overturn any election results they don’t like?  This is how civil wars get started.
0	The fabled new trade deals might sound a little more positive if it weren’t for our failures to negotiate with the EU. If we cant do that properly, exactly how well will will do against the trade negotiators from the US, China or India?
1	I congratulate every Englishman on regaining freedom. Only those who have never been FREE can put up with the constant patronizing of unknown bureaucrats. Everyone else doesn't like this at all. Switzerland will now certainly strengthen economic relations with England.👍 nice party, I am looking forward to seeing you. Best wishes and greetings from Switzerland
1	Lots of countries doing good that are not in the EU.  Look at Norway and Switzerland.
0	Isolation isn't good for children, inmates or countries
1	give them hell. EU is more or less finished. just put them out of their misery.
1	”Fake news! UK will prosper as soon as Bojo signes that fantastic America first trade deal.”
0	Can Farage or the brits understand how much Ireland wants the brits OUT of Ireland? Irony? Scotland wants you out too!
1	Just heard some fireworks to celebrate #Brexit
0	It’s been Putin’s plan all along, to undermine democracies, the EU and NATO ... and it’s been working fab here in the US and over there now. Yet he couldn’t have done it without solid participation from so many of us ... let’s hope this darkness lifts soon.
0	Look at the clowns hair. He looks an incoherent mess just like his Brexit trade policy.
1	I'll keep fighting for the best, most successful Brexit.
1	The uk had no power over the eu, it did as it liked , it leaked money like it was going out of fashion and was demanding control of member nations, none of that is good.
1	I'm Dutch but I'm jealous of the UK being separated of  the EU. I wish we were!
1	The people of Europe are already now starting to voice their desires for their own referendums.  The EU was a political project that never really had the mandate of the people that matter most - its citizens.  A new Europe will emerge from this eventually , one where states work in partnership, not force laws, directive, rules, down each others throats from a central power.
1	The bosses love foreign workers. They are non-union, cheap and pliable. The British people who used to do those jobs have not gone on to university, they have gone on the dole or worse. There is also an issue over the conditions that the foreign workers have to endure, and the housing situation in the UK is abysmal.  Elite media types and people like Bob Geldof have failed to understand the concerns of normal people. They look down on us and call us racist, but they are the ones guilty of bigotry.  Britain became a socialist country after the second world war through the sacrifices of ordinary people. A welfare state was their reward. Now to be poor is a sin and you are attacked from every direction, so there was an element of a “stuff you” protest vote.  The EU sacrificed cohesion for expansion that seems to be run by Germany. Angela Merkel decided to allow 1 million migrants into Germany, breaking EU law and not consulting the Bundestag. Germany broke Greece and is offering expedited negotiations to allow Turkey into the EU. They do not consult and it is not a union.  Britain seemed stuck on the fringe of the EU and our path to greater assimilation wasn’t clear. There is no plan for creating a Europe with the same taxes and minimum wage, so the movement of people adversely affects those countries with better conditions. The EU is monolithic and so hard to understand. Where is it going? It failed to make itself clear, simple and accountable. It just rumbles on.  The EU has had a negative impact on the countries that surround it, with the Ukraine feeling part of another sphere of influence and migrants from Africa dying in the Mediterranean due to failures of planning. I was pro-EU, feeling that Europeans had a better standard of living than us, but became disillusioned as it expanded to include countries like Romania. I can’t see how being in a union with failed states benefits us.  During the referendum campaign I was shocked by how much the establishment failed to provide balanced views. Reports were churned out that predicted the worst case scenarios of Brexit but not the best. I am happy, but concerned, that if Scotland gets a referendum to leave the UK then England and Wales will be stuck in Tory hell for a century. I believe Scotland is its own country and maybe should become independent. They may be worse off financially, but freedom is worth a lot.  I hope that the Labour party unites under a strong leader like Alan Johnson and re-engages with its traditional support base. Labour needs leaders from the same streets that its supporters come from. Actually I think we need proportional representation so we can focus on issues rather than party politics.
1	think we can allow ourselves a couple of days  to feel  triumphant.   After that, back to work with a vengeance, knowing we are working for ourselves.  As for the bill for £1.9 billion, marked 2019-2020, surely we only need to pay a twelfth of that?  We aren't going to be there for the other eleven months, we don't pay rent on an empty house?
1	god bless nigel farage and the british nation
0	Did we finally find a positive of Brexit?
0	So, challenge of the day to our Brexiter friends. Give us an example of how the EU’s lack of democracy has disadvantaged the UK.
1	the UK’s priority in the negotiations is to ensure that we restore our economic and political independence on 1 January 2021. That is the government’s primary objective. If asked to expand, we will ensure that we will have the right to regulate and are not constrained by EU law or the court of justice of the European Union
0	When the brexit crashed pound hits the fan the streets will be paved with gold...
1	As it stands I’m voting to leave, Cameron will have to to come up with something very special for me to change my mind
1	They'll have to start raiding their piggy banks when we leave and they can't use us as a cash cow any more!
0	I think it's going to be bad very bad no one know what will happen
1	Britain will be just fine
1	well we voted leave and the economy is booming employment records zooming .exports shooting to the sky.. the lion is awake and roaring .return of the the Man.
1	The UK needs to recognise that her economic and international fortune has always laid further afield overseas than just the Continent
0	All signs point to REMAIN. Sorry guys, but your dream off booting people back to Dover is OVER. Open the floodgates I say.
0	You obviously have a national death wish. All Brexit options will be bad for the UK. No Deal Brexit will be a national catastrophe.
1	Our trade with EU is a deficit so more money goes out than in.
1	Good bye and good riddance to the EU globalist elite! God wins! Satanic NWO lose!
0	The rest of the world must be wondering why the UK is celebrating its relegation to the 2nd Division.
0	A make-believe Big Ben rather than the real Big Ben. Am I the only one who thinks that is deeply symbolic of Brexit?
0	Good to see a decent amount of the public does have some intelligence
1	God bless Western civilisation!
0	I haven't heard any Leave MPs saying that Brexit will be a success for about a year to 15 months now. Certainly it's considered common knowledge that we'll all be poorer., with less opportunities - and that it will especially hurt the poor. No-one even debates that any more.
0	A Brexit that was engineered by the rich few who are the only ones who stand to profit from this disaster.
1	You've regained sovereignty!
0	The biggest threat to our civilization is not evil people doing evil things but good people doing nothing. A lesson much of the West might be learning too late. Again.
0	People trade; Countries don’t.
0	Australia-style’ Brexit agreement means no deal
1	Why should we respect MPs votes when they don't respect People's votes?
0	Brexit would mean a huge loss of jobs.  On the plus side, my train to work will be less busy in the mornings.
1	The UK will prosper if people want it to succeed. The only thing that will hold it back is continuously negative commentaries from disenchanted Remoaners.
1	I was asleep at 11pm. Dreaming of better days and what might have been
1	What’s more important a national referendum of all the people or a vote of a few hundred MPs bought by Eurocrats in Brussels?  Remainers: whichever vote favors us, but regardless we are the ones for democracy in action!
1	I was not asked if I wanted to ne tuled by Brussels, a couple of elite MP’s signed our country over to the EU without our consent.
1	Freedom self determination
1	happy Brexit day to all the good people of Britain who stood firm and stopped your children’s future being robbed , hopefully the ferry’s and Eurostar are packed out with saboteur remainers leaving space for our new points based immigration system to swap them for some genuine quality ! See we’re not racist , it’s always been about a persons quality and integrity , remainers have none THANKS NIGEL
1	OUTSTANDING! Another direct hit to the global socialists.
1	There is an urgent need for British business and civil society, of course to reengage with us and we hope they will do that, and we expect they will
1	E.U. Propagander  at its Worst
1	Congrats to the Brits from USA! You are no longer under the control under of the un-elected elites in Brussel. Don't let the elites trick you to get back into the EU!
0	I find it mildly amusing that remainers somehow think their tragic lives will be in the slightest bit affected by the outcome of any final negotiation. When you’ve got nothing already you can lose nothing.
0	Yet she didn't mention 2 million brits working in EU.
0	I'm still raging.   I see us a Northern European country, with many common connections across the North Sea.  I feel like I've had people and things I believed in torn away from me.   I was always pro-Yes, and genuinely believed that the best future for Scotland was one where the people of Scotland who lived and worked here were ones who made the decisions about the future of our nation.  Brexit has only solidified my view that Scotland should be an independent, *European* nation.   tl;dr: fuck Brexit.
0	I don't think we will be going it alone. We still have good friends.
1	Let's not slate a trade deal that hasn't happened yet.
1	Scotland can bugger off if they like. Let them be dominated by their EU masters.
0	GET THIS BACKSTOP SORTED
0	Should the UK left be optimistic about our future outside the EU? No, they should stop farting around, get together and stop it happening.
0	Nice analogy except it wasn't an abusive relationship in any way. We prospered thanks to our membership.
0	Brexit is what happens when a false sense of superiority combines with a false sense of victimhood; an insecure and parad…

0	Welcome to Brexit Britain. And it's about to get a whole lot worse. Shame on anyone who voted for this.
0	It's all smoke and mirrors BJ is a conman.
1	Dredging is restricted by the EU because it damages the habitat of fish. Result floods.
0	Let the Breshiteers do the jobs, the EU citizens know very well that they have another 27 European countries were they can move without suffering abuse from the population, media or the Home office. No one wants to move to a country were speaking your language can be the cause of their death.
0	One thing I miss here is that xou didn‘t look into what the membership fees did FOR the UK economy.
0	Regrexit!!!
1	Keep calm and leave the eu

1	BEST PM EVER KNIGHTHOOD FOR NIGEL
1	This Is England, Returned to a Sovereign Nation.
0	No words express my sadness what happened to my beautiful Britain and its loving people, full of memories, friendships, living out a childhood fantasy. I am devastated, god bless you and us all.
0	Johnson wants no deal. He wants to blame the EU for our post Brexit recession. He wants thick Brexiters to see change even if it’s bad. Brexit voters want to see men in peaked caps and clipboards and long queues at ports and airports. This country is rapidly going down the pan.
0	Stupidity at its height. Wait until food prices start to soar. What an absolutely assinine move.
1	the only thing they will miss is our money
1	Great day have our own courts Nd rules no more propping up prop ourselves for a change
1	I am so glad I am not a remainer. Many seem desperate for their country and fellow citizens to suffer so that they can be proved right. What a mean-spirited, narrow-minded outlook on life. And what if the UK does well? Will they simply become ever more embittered? Move on for God's sake, if only for the sake of your own mental health.
1	To me I am happy they are out and then everyone can get on with life and business.
0	RIP UK. Hope Scotland can run for their lives.
1	Hail @Nigel_Farage for not giving up and not letting down the believers of this country. #BrexitDay
1	The Brits have shown us that you can leave the European Union, and you can come out better.
1	HAPPY INDEPENDENCE DAY BRITAIN!
0	his separation is  what Putin wanted and paid Brrexit for.  The info coming out before the final vote  He played the nationalism card disappearing with modern air transportion and the  net.  A global community wfith conversations Private enterrprise profit or not..
0	Hmmm... Almost as if brexit will be terrible for business... Hmmm...
0	UK will still be in europe an island cant move.
0	Beginning of the fall of the EU, HA! More like the beginning of the fall of the UK
0	And now Scotland gets independence and we join back to the EU
0	Brexit is for the richest in our country: they can afford recessions.
0	Looks like voting to leave the EU was a pretty fucking stupid idea, huh?
0	It's all downhill from here isn't it? I hope Johnson and his cabinet crash and burn along the way.
0	Loved the interviews where people couldn't explain what we are able to do now we have left EU
1	It doesn’t really matter, what matters is we are now governed by politicians who are actually accountable to the electorate, it’s called democracy. Unfortunately the EU is no longer a true democracy.
1	New World Order lost!!!!
0	Last time I checked, Great Britain is still in Europe. They only left a phoney "post-national" organization
1	That would be the sexy Brexit vampire that hangs around forever like an undead stalker, impermeable to reason!
1	Congrats to the British people....you beat the globalists.
1	They are afraid that will will be much more competitive. Which we can be now we have left .
0	Brexit Destroyed UK. we want #SecondReferendum
1	"Death to the EU, Death to the EU"!
0	If you support Brexit, this is the side you've chosen. If you get called a small-minded, xenophobic twat it's because the side…
1	A strong, independent country needs control of its own laws. That process starts now.
0	For remainers that means embracing the opportunities and for leavers understanding Brexit is not an end in itself.
0	Leaving the European Union was a big mistake. You will all regret it in a few years
1	This “weaker, poorer” EU institution is one that Britain is desperate to have a trade deal with.
1	The reaction to seeing the union flag by that hateful bigoted old bint was priceless. She opened even more eyes to the authoritarian dreams of the EU. So thanks.
0	My heart goes out to the British who voted to remain hopefully things will work out for your country in the end. From, an American who didn't vote for Trump.
0	United you stand. Divided you go extinct. Humans will never unite, so extinction it is. Just a matter of time. Mark my words.
1	Weird I thought the people already voted to leave, why do the politicians need to vote on it?
0	Very disappointing was expecting Boris to poke his head through the letterbox at Number 10 and fire off just a single Party Popper
0	Many brexiters have accused me of hating Britain. Perhaps this will clarify: Some UK achievements/ppl I'm proud of.
1	You will feel a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of remain voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.
1	They don't have to pay outrageous taxes to EU anymore, and take in hostile migrants, who want to use their women as incubators and mooch
0	Brexit: the greatest exercise ever in pretending not to be racist
1	Congratulations you  got it done. Long live Europe. Show the world something great as you both forge ahead. Independence is always a great achievement on any level.
0	Liars shall not prosper. The weaker, more fragile union will disintegrate. The weaker union is the UK.
1	Brexit now.
1	happy to hear God saved the Queen! #proBrexit
1	Go boris
1	I understand the rationale for EU membership if you are one of the countries receiving charity, but it's a shame the French and Germans don't have the balls to stand up and insist on a referendum, polls have shown their ordinary hard working people would vote leave in bigger numbers that the UK
1	it's such a beautiful thing seeing the UK do what is right. they at least give their country a chance
0	you will wake up soon an realise, you’ve made a massive mistake. Trust me. It’ll take some time but you’ll come around
1	We really must put most of our efforts into negotiating trade deals with the rest of the World. The bureaucratic EU will drone on and on, for month after month, with little or no progress being made.
1	Independence day has finally arrived in spite of the anti Democrats.
1	Up until we joined this federalist-inclined, supra-national superstate, we controlled our own destiny and made peace and war in Europe according to what policy best furthered our interests.
0	Within 10 to 25 years, the United Kingdom will not exist as it does today. Northern Ireland, Scotland, and maybe Wales will secede from the United Kingdm and rejoin the EU.
1	A deal to allow continued tariff-free trading would be secured even if the UK left the single market, EU
1	ITS SAD really but also good now they(UK)  can only blame themselves and not automatically on Europe. The EU yep big problems have to fight it... now the dutch on there own well that's, not real fear against the Frenchies( they have to much power)  . Have fun anyway , we still like ya brits .
0	Once it's done Boris, let's give Sturgeon a good kick in baws. Good man, carry on.
0	It is a shitshow, and there should never have been a referendum on this.  The only reason David Cameron called one is because of stupid party  politics, not for the good of the country or for democracy or anything  like that.  Most people don't know even nearly enough about the EU, how it works,  how it benefits us, its long term strategies etc. People genuinely  think that the EU 'controls' the UK and that unelected officials in  Brussels make up laws and force us to adopt them, which is just utterly  untrue. There is so much misinformation that it's scary - democracy is  obviously a great thing, but only when the electorate actually have the  facts, when the media is unbiased etc. As it stands, people are voting  totally blind and ignorant.  The EU does more for our country than our own government,  particularly for the poorer areas. If the UK votes out, it means our  government will lurch to the right. Even if you're not pro-EU, if you're  not keen on the idea of a very right-wing era being ushered in, then  vote remain.
1	From the US - Congratulations on saving your country. I have complete confidence the British people will prosper.
0	One year until the UK crashes and burns.
1	The UK pays 55 million a day in to the EU for what ? 75% of our powers have been given to them so we can’t make our own decisions. We did not vote to be in the EU and are entitled to one . Generations have fought and died in wars to keep it from foreign rule . The EU takes more from us then we get back
1	Good riddance to the anti-democratic, petty, spiteful, hate inciting,  authoritarian, tax raping, money laundering, corrupt  EU!
1	Let the brits die alone.
0	Brexit, is not going to end well.
0	People voted against immigration and thought Brexit will remedy this . Yeah here you go .Well done
0	The British betrayed the European Union to declare Scotland independence, joins the EU. I London. Let it be a city state that joins the European Union.
1	Happy #BrexitDay , the day where remainers finally become leavers. 3 years of pointless petitions, pointless marches and a biased speaker couldnt stop the wish of 17.4m people. A victory for our democracy. Rule Britannia 🇬🇧
0	The most extraordinary act of unsollicited self harm any nation has ever committed on the tune of snake oil merchants and charlatans.
1	FANTASTIC we are LEAVING the CORRUPT EU.
1	Great Britain we love you and now even more that great Britain will be independent country
1	Im from America the continent not the USA, but the way I see it it was a great idea that is being implemented horribly
0	🤣🤣 imagine that bulgarian and romanian passport will be better than british passport 🤭🤭
0	As an Irishman in the UK I now have more influence and opportunity than a british citizen. I can vote in your elections and live and work anywhere in the EU. What have you gained?
1	47 years of EUSSR slavery
0	let's see for how long those people will celebrate in UK
1	5 people run the EU. Reason enough to get the F*ck out.
1	Happy independence day everyone!!!!!!
1	we’ll be able to take back COMPLETE control of our fishing grounds!
1	They have been in positions of power where they could have stood up for the British, but like all the other pro-EU parties just carried on.
0	Work together be proud to be European and member of the EU.
0	Nobody really felt any of the actual effects of it, because we hadn’t yet had to look at border checks, we hadn’t had to consider what happens to our right to live, work, study and love in another country.”
0	Remain. Given that we do so much trade with the countries of the EU I think it's in our national interest to have a say in how the EU is run
1	Happy independence day.
1	Germany has 100% control over Europe. Britain won the War BUT Germany wins Europe
0	When the people who voted for brexit lose their jobs I will happily tell you I told ya so!!!
0	Don’t worry, we are free now, the way is clear to become a Third World power. With Boris steering the ship we can achieve this quickly and painfully.
1	The UK government plans to spend hundreds of millions of pounds on new infrastructure and investments in Scotland
0	They belong to Europe like Austria, Belgium & Cyprus!
1	I voted Leave, and would do so again. I believe the UK is better off outside the political institution that is the EU. But better off has many meanings, for me its a mixture of political, social, and economic issues, whereas most these days seem to be solely fixed on the economic aspects.
0	it turns out they are all batshit crazy. But it's funny how Scotland and Ireland voted against leaving. So you know whtat that means? Good bye UK
0	Yeah I’m sorry, but a massive proportion of us don’t believe any of that. We see economic uncertainty, risky trade deals with the United States, Northern Ireland and Scotland leaving the union, and a generation impoverished of the opportunities of the rest of Europe.
1	Time to take our country back Let's go Red card to the eu Let's take our country back! auf veedetsen Angela Bye yo Borat We want our country back
0	For me personally, I think that a leave vote would be awful for UK  science. I'm a PhD student in Chemistry, and my research group is about  60-40 UK-'foreign' workers. We're funded by a Wellcomme trust high level  strategic grant, so pretty important research. We have people from  Hungary, Romania, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece. It's the same  throughout the University. Leaving the EU would directly impact our  ability to recruit top talent, and which would in turn reduce our  ability to produce high level research - one of the UK's strengths.
0	There really is nothing to celebrate.
1	It is better to be alone than in an abusive relationship.
0	It will reduce the power of the UK, It will not ‘teach those politicians/bureaucrats/elitists/whoever a lesson’.
1	England does NOT need Belgium telling it where or where not they can fish, in their own territories! Well done mates!!!
0	Customs barriers will take the UK back decades.
0	And soon because of it there wont be a UK.
1	Really hope this is the beginning of the end of EU that killed all the economy of Italy
0	Tomorrow morning I'll wake up a European Citizen with rights to work, live and travel across borders. But I'll go to bed with that stolen from me.
0	Brexit has no worthy objectives and no likely positive outcomes
0	Cheer now, Cry for the outcome!
0	So Brexit was about opening doors to people from common wealth LOL
1	Shouldn’t we be celebrating and embracing leaving the EU, rather than avoiding referring to it? Assuming it’s a positive thing in the main? I mean, the government does think it’s a positive thing, yes? Johnson wouldn’t be proBrexit just to gain power and win over supporters?
0	I was pretty vocal about being anti-Brexit before the referendum vote.
0	No, it was an act of war on half the nation, land loss is that, always. We want to remain, we will remain. The referendum leave campaign was based on lies. Therefore you were not informed of the actual issues at stake. Therefore democracy was compromised. Therefore this PM should be in jail for subverting democracy, and the result annulled.
0	Just another sorry chapter in our history.  Let's hope that it will not need to be repeated yet again!  Let sense and wisdom prevail, alongside a goodly dollop of humanity, love and respect for all.
1	Though I'm very Leave, I agree with a one off 10% wealth tax on the richest companies and people (say assets more than half a million)In England to help the poorer nations of Europe adjust. International solidarity. Only a certain type of person could possibly object.
1	What a breath of fresh air to have a leader with some backbone unlike the weak and feeble Theresa May who grovelled and capitulated at every turn, while looking like a scared rabbit in the headlights.
1	I've just never been prouder of my country... Brexit day is about celebrating not just Brexit it's about celebrating democracy. It's alive and well and kicking in Britain.
1	The day of a new future has dawned. WE will make of it what we will.The British character has never lacked the passion or capacity to deliver and we certainly won't be lacking now.Happy Independence day to all.
0	Stop Brexit from happen! We would only suffer....
0	So for those having a party and celebrating with a bottle of bubbly from France ( Champagne) Italy (Prosecco) or Spain (Cava) bottoms up, as you will soon be finding all those things you have taken for granted evaporating - but you all knew that anyway, didn't you?
1	Sadly I think that it is inevitable that the UK will leave the EU. That said, as things stand I would not support continued membership.
0	So in short: nothing has changed. The EU and UK need to find a deal and until that happens nobody has a clue what brexit actually means.
0	Brexit - something that never should have been put to a referendum. A lose/lose for the UK and the EU. Another foreign policy win for Vladimir Putin.
1	No. The overriding sense is that, at long last, the British people are in charge. It's a horrible thought for the Guardian, I acknowledge.
1	They took their country back from the EU and we're taking ours back from the socialists in November!
0	Dead right utter nonsense Brexiteers have no solution.
1	Brexit saved Britain from hoard of East European paupers messing up British economy. There's no reason why Britain will not do better outside EU.
1	On 31th of January, at 11pm, after 30 years of resistance, the great people of Britain had finally got Brexit done ! Our proud nation finally left the eussr ’superstate’...
1	This is about loving being a part of Europe but hating being a part of the European Union.
0	We’re stronger together though
0	Today is a sad day. Brexit is what happens when a false sense of superiority combines with a false sense of victimhood. We should be reaching out to our European friends rather than walking away from them. It is better to be internationalist rather than isolationist.
1	Doesn't it make you feel proud!
0	Officially #Brexit day. And nothing, nothing is securely planned for our future, but 130bn has been spent. Unbelievable.
0	With no deal,all goods will be checked anywhere in the world the second after Brexit
1	Immigration and Sovereignty...Leave Now!!
0	Ordinary UK persons don't even understand the implications of this thing called Brexit. And why would they. Politics are sold in hyperboles and mindlessness in bulk. In fact I doubt even the so called MPs understand the nuances and nth degree ramifications with probability distribution attached.
0	I bet this will be a disaster probably Ireland and Scotland will withdraw from the United Kingdom and Johnson will be begging the eu for a deal putting Britain even more under their thumb than when it was a member
1	I still don't regret voting to leave the European Union. Every time I see a politician whining, or trying to undo the vote it makes me even prouder to have voted Leave.
1	Dear #Remainers, #Leavers are our teachers, our doctors, our nurses, our grans, our nephews, our neighbours, our volunteers in charities, our pillars of the community, our foodbank contributors. They're half of us. Disagree with them, by all means. But we have to live together.
0	Just so long as this absurd Brexit nonsense is scrapped ASAP, I'll be happy.  Brexit was never possible without re-igniting "The Troubles" probably following border shootings related to smuggling.   Mogg and Johnson never went to Belfast when terrorism was at its height and don't understand the issues.   Cameron got bored, didn't care and decided it was better to risk splitting the country rather than the Tory party. Lets hope future prime ministers are chosen on ability not their school.
1	I am voting Leave. I don't really like the idea of eurocrats in brussels deciding my future. I have found it amazing seeing friends on Facebook shout passionately about how voting In is the only choice and that believing anything other that that makes me an idiot racist. I have found the In campaign to be the vocal minority. I turn on sky news and it is just seems to be pushing doom and gloom for the UK economy if we leave. The current government just seems to be pushing fear and I am really bored of it. To say that the only way that we can exist as part of Europe and will only prosper as part of it, seems idiotic to me.
1	The UK should remember that their own roots are far better than those of the EU.
0	Never fear, Europe will protect the torch of civilization now that Britain has abandoned progress and slips back into darkness. Condolences to British Europeans trapped within the belly of the hard-right beast occupying power in the isles at this time. Condolences to Europeans of British origin living in Europe and to British-residing Europeans. Condolences to posterity and the generations that have now had their better futures stolen from them by these fascist monsters and on the basis of pure demagoguery and naked lies; illegitimately.
0	We’re still not happy about Brexit but at least one good thing is that the NHS will be receiving £350 million a week from now on
1	I am a supporter of democracy so would be hypocritical if I didn't support Brexit.
1	Yeahhhhh at last we’re out of the most corrupt institution going
0	i hope the British suffer
1	This reminds me of a caged animal, afraid to come out when the door is opened. Then peopld, who want to be smart and in control, saying you won't be safe.
0	You won't know what you've lost until it's gone, little Britain. The utter stupidity. The incoherent mindlessness.
0	Some people actually voted for a man who just purposely waved a beautiful flag around in an insulting and childish way to annoy every other representative in that room at such an important moment of political history. That’s all I’m saying.
1	That's all ways been the problem with EU, they just donot understand our language.
1	After the fall of communism and before unification, was the border between West & East Germany a problem?
0	I am growing suspicious of Brexit. They are separating from EU and creating more integrated ties with the US..This might prove to be a mistake.. The NIH might become subject to Big Pharma and the health insurers desire to privatize through subversion
1	congratulations England for Brexit, well done Johnson:)
1	Honestly this is the EU's fault for treating the UK like second-class citizens when they were clearly one of the most wealthy countries in the agreement, the EU relied on the UK significantly, yet Brussels made all of the decisions about policy in the UK.
0	Brexit @%#!$*!
1	Happy Breximas
0	That woman ,from Manchester is wrong,i live in North ,i am nowhere near been rich and i voted Remain because i am well educated now and understand the game.
0	It is a joke, England in Thatcher era urged the world to globalized now hahahahah
1	Praise God!
1	A slight drop in growth is a price worth paying, in the long run. There will be no Britain at all in the future if we stay in the EU. A few GDP points? Bargain.
0	Arch Remoaner Lord Adonis accuses BBC of 'radicalising' public to vote for Brexit! BBC biased TOWARD Brexit?
0	It is a sad moment and I believe it is a loss both for Europe and for the UK.
1	Yes yes yes. We are not in the EU. Why do we pay more for car insurance holiday insurance. Road tolls. What could we buy for 55milllion a day. We have immigrants in our street in new houses never worked taxi every where and a new car. And loads of ASB. They never came to work they came for the quote (soft ENGLISH).
0	This is the perfect example of the tyranny of the (small) majority
0	Brexit is beyond criminal. Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings are criminals.  They will go down in infamy.
1	and the there's people crying into lit candles, speaking about it being a grieving process? it feels like her europeaness has been taken away haha. no it's your brains what's been taken away love.
0	The two things guaranteed to enrage Brexiters and their super childish populism - logic and common sense.
1	I don't like free movement of people into the UK.
1	Congratulations Boris. I am delighted that the will of the British people has succeeded in the end. I originally voted leave, but I was so annoyed by remoaners I want to leave. More power to your elbow sir 👍🇬🇧
1	hey're still trying to dictate to us , even though we're now out
0	So Great-Britain is basically acting like an entitled mom. GOT IT!
0	Scottish parliament votes to hold new independence referendum
0	The whole Brexit saga is, in my view, one big, terrifying leap in the dark.
0	I honestly don't think this will make any difference including the immigration problem people seemed to mainly vote for.
1	My fellow leave voters, today is our day. It's been 3 years 7 months of fighting and now our moment is finally here. Let get this party started. #BrexitDay
1	Congrats to Great Britain for finally getting it done. Long live the queen.
0	“I have a cunning plan” declares novice sailor Baldrick, aka @BorisJohnson as he signs the log book and takes the good ship HMS Blighty out into the north Atlantic, searching for an iceberg.
1	Deal or not, Brexit is the way to go. Yeah! BORIS
1	The EU is a total sham of a democracy. It cheapens the idea of democracy.
1	The left wing bbc are pissed
0	Britains most idiotic self inflicted economic wound led by the most appropriate buffoon of a leader ....knock yourselves out Britain
1	UK will survive brexit despite the politicians, dont panic and carry on. There is a lot of negativity spread by lobbies.
0	Brexit is a licence for racists and xenophobes to come out of the closet
1	The Norway option could have been the best of both worlds in an increasingly turbulent future, and the moderate majority of both sides would have settled for that IMO.
0	Brexit was ruined from the start, they never intended on actually doing it.
1	After 47 years as obnoxious troublemakers in the EU, I think many Europeans thought that way! Thank goodness we got rid of the dead weight
0	Ah celebrating their right to become more irrelevant.
0	The fact is the UK has always had very strong voice in the EU, so I wonder Why they want out
1	The economy will adapt and be far stronger after we leave. But it won't be painless.
0	The Brexit Job Loss Index is an attempt to keep track of the number of jobs lost in the UK due to Brexit. Look which part of the UK has suffered the most already…
0	If you wrote a book about the history of hypocrisy Brexit would need it's own standalone volume.
0	It is the same people who claim there is a climate crisis. They have no grasp on reality, and/or no interest in the truth
0	Congrats! UK is out of EU. What will happen next. Country will become more expensive
1	And if Ireland enter our waters after Brexit they'll be cut off too.
1	Some people say that Reddit isn't all that liberal, but look at all the top comments and you'll see that it is overwhelmingly so. Also i will be voting to leave.
1	Finaly a country had the kohone to leave!
0	Single use plastics, the EU didn't prevent you legislating that, did it?
1	at the very least.... the British people are back in charge of their own future, and will prove the "People" are once again correct.
1	I voted leave because I wanted my country to be able to govern itself and look after it's own interests.
0	A message to the EU from Scotland " We'll be back"
0	Without EU England is nothing this days
1	INDEPENDENCE IS OURS
0	Nothing happens. Only a fool would think anything will change tonight. It's just given the masses what they wanted - a brexit day. Behind it, it's all the same.
1	Driving forward by focussing on the rear view mirror is rather pointless, don’t you think?
1	The EU is as bad as Democrats trying to take our guns
0	This country is finished. Over.
1	We left the EU In control of our armed forces and intelligence services
0	I think Brexit is a disaster unfolding. Corporations control this world. It will get worse once we leave.
0	Maybe the belligerent rhetoric is aimed at individual EU member nations, to make those most exposed to a complete rupture break ranks and split EU unity. Kind of poison the bear.
0	Boris, how about FREE SPEECH, in Britain!
0	We are the in and a major contributor. But certain things need to change to make things better for all. But we need to stay in or else we will loose out big time.
1	accelerate EU trade talks, maximise the advantage, take control.
0	I’m glad they made it out.
0	Economic consequences of Brexit are overwhelmingly negative
1	I can totally see why the majority of Brexit voters would rather not be a part of EU.
1	Their loss not ours. Rule Britannia!
0	Freedom requires morality and a sense of common purpose. The UK doesn't have that anymore.
1	Europe isn’t the EU and the EU isn’t Europe.  I love visiting Europe but I’m not interested in the EU.
1	Stop talking the country down, Simon. If only we were more optimistic we would succeed. (Am I doing it right)
0	EU is a peace project
0	Many financial institutions, car manufacturers have left the UK already. Warehouses have been reallocated to mainland Europe. Keep on dreamin that you will be better off Britains.
0	Oh my God everything is just the same as it was it's a miracle lol
0	And what happens to the millions of British people living, studying and working abroad? Imagine all the retired Brits in Spain coming back and claiming on the NHS.
0	The UK used to be one of the Rule Makers. Welcome to your future... A Rule Taker.
0	Before joining EU Britain used to dump all their raw sewage into the sea, of course Britain doesn't want any bindings with the regulations with EU
0	they are gonna regret this stupid emotional decision. too much emotions were triggered.
1	I am an unabashed Anglophile  and I see this as a great day for all of you. Europe was holding you back.
0	#Brexit pulled the lever. We are now in that period between the trapdoor opening and the noose snapping tight
0	Oh well more terrorist attacks to come, Lord Rothchild Jacob can't be to happy aye
0	The beginning of the end, so sad. I hope I am wrong but I do think that many people do not understand how much mess we are still in and when did we lose our sovereignty... it’s a nonsense. We do most of our trade with the EU our product will not sell there if they do not conform to their standards. Now we have no say in what those standards will be..... madness.
0	By stopping Brexit, investing in skills and providing tailored support to key industries, we can get the UK economy back on track and help the communities that have been hit hardest by the threat of Brexit.
1	Its going to be fantastic after 47 years in prison!
1	A wonderful moment for those of us who voted to leave in June 2016
1	When it is blatantly obvious that size is a critical factor in this new global presence....and some force is attempting to demonstrate that size matters less in this new dynamic world because they have some stardust qualities that can supplement for size....I wait in eagerness to be proven completely and catastrophically wrong of my illogical reasoning
1	When other nations find out how well we have done in the future without the EU, they will leave too
1	Why was there a second vote?
1	The ones that are not celebrating are the ones being paid by the central bank they know it will be gone soon
0	Congratulations to the backward-looking xenophobic little Englanders!Your vote means a poorer future for your children & grandchildren & a diminished role for whatever remains of the UK.I wonder how many of you will live long enough to see the results of your folly?I imagine you have full confidence that Johnson and his like will carry out their promises when the coffers are empty.
0	Brexit is not ‘done’. But its new challenges could address some old problems
1	To be a free nation, we have to leave the UN, it is corrupt and destructive to the west
1	How can we do same? Please help!
1	Soon, very soon, they will be so glad they have left. All of them.
0	Scotland should go independent. Best of luck to England with Brexit but we should go our own way now
1	How can you constructively give an answer to a situation or prediction about the future when it hasn't happened yet i really hope and think Britain will prosper from the dictatorship from unelected Brussel leaders whos interests are their first priority
0	As a brit, Brexit makes me feel sick. Still an EU citizen at heart, wish I could be labelled European British
0	Now we're bobbing in the ocean alone with countless of Great White sharks circuling us. Get ready for the greatest ever fire sale.
1	Elites and moneyed people are this morning sneering over their avacado toast at the working classes that voted for Brexit . Butthurt levels are through the roof.
0	U.K. should and will stay in Europe! But EU officials should listen and change some of their policy of burocracy and dictating..
0	I think that 70 years of peace in Europe, led to loss of memory - The E.U. it's not ONLY economy....
0	Brexit: What happens after the UK leaves the EU?  Answer: Nothing much ( for now).
1	The EU is a road accident and the UK is now in a car passing by on the other side of the road watching but glad not to be involved.
0	Lets build a wall and make the EU pay for it.
0	So we'll be exposed to predatory monopolies, our market is going to be flooded with cheap products subsidised by foreign governments and we're going to scrap social protection and environmental standards. Yippee.
0	When he talks about welfare programs and minimum wage I know he just has to say these things to make sure he keeps the northern working-class voter base on his side.
1	BREXIT might cause a Summer of Love !
0	Brexit is fueled mainly by ignorance, bigotry and xenophobia. I haven't heard one cogent economic argument for it. Just one would be enough to consider it. But nope, not even one.
1	Way to go Britain. Finally someone puts their foot down.
0	#StopBrexitSaveBritain Thank you for your support for a people's vote. We must stop Brexit, leaving the EU will damage the country and it's economy and cost thousands of jobs. #PeoplesVote
1	The EU should break up a long time ago.
1	Brexit could actually be a great opportunity given the massive organizational shifts that are to come globally in the next decade
1	Exactly what we voted for..we never voted to be in the European Union.. only the common market.. now we're Free again
1	Cancelling brexit means cancelling democracy. It means not giving people what they chose. It is a TERRIBLE, very serious precedent. I expect people supporting brexit filling the streets soon!
0	How can BoJo expect to strike the best ever deal with EU if he continuously criticises the EU 27? He's incredibly childish and a shame to UK.
0	I voted remain but feel that in the right hands Brexit could have worked. It was hijacked by Mr Johnson: a career opportunist and fantasist - and a dangerous one at that. The issue for me was why people voted in the first place to leave and suggest it was because people outside London felt they were being ignored and due to the lack of real info. at the time voted for their own visions of Brexit.
1	god bless you nigel
1	Brilliant article! I like in particular how you make reference to, and describe, those people and institutions that tried so hard to thwart Brexit and failed miserably. Why should we ever take these people or institutions seriously again. I really admire the grit, steel and determination of Boris Johnson, the influence and far reaching strategic vision of Dominic Cummings and the ERG for their constant pressure on people like May. Oh, and let’s not forget the crucial part that Nigel Farage has played in all of this, without his lifetime fight to exit the EU we would not be where we are today.
0	I don't like Brexit voters
0	While I agree that there are problems with mass migration, and British voters have the right to vote on a referendum, Cameron was an absolute dunce to even allow the vote.   Brexit, while popular in some circles, will cause havoc in Europe.
0	UK is completely f'd and Trumpish nationalist politics in UK a la Boris Johnson (UK's very own "orange one") is directly responsible for this. Next up...USA!
0	If you #GetBrexitDone via #NoDeal then there is NO SUCH THING as “getting it done”, as you STILL have to do a trade deal (which takes 10yrs) & even then you’d have no more bargaining chips! The UK would be utterly on the back foot! Poker players cannot raise AFTER they’ve folded!
0	It turns out, we like EU regulations, but we just don't want em. We're idiots.
0	The British establishment hates anything which it doesn't have direct and total control over. Our membership of the EU - I mean full and proper membership - would make most of the draconian laws and "measures" taken by the tories and their nu-labour camp followers, illegal in Europe. In the same style as the dirty campaign waged against the SNP, truth is sacrificed for the sake of rabble-rousing. Come the day that Cameron and his owners ever do take our country out of the EU, we might as well all go and live in mud huts while serving our masters in the "grand house". The feudal system is alive and well and living here in Great Britain.
1	GET BREXIT DONE!
1	Hey the people already voted actually.
1	Can Remainers continue complaining after we have left? Maybe they should rename them selves the Returners and start campaigning to return.
1	God Protect Britain from Radical Islam... Lots of Love For Britain and Brittons From India...
0	The price of a small parcel from Germany to GB will go up 7 EUR tomorrow. Thanks for nothing, Brexiters.
1	An exit deal with the EU is beneficial for both parties
0	I don’t understand all the details. But it seems to be one of those things where people may have shot themselves in the foot by voting to leave, perhaps not understanding all the details either. Especially when you look at the leaders who’ve  been in charge of that whole thing this whole time.
1	I dont have a dog in this fight, but I am so happy for the Brits.
1	Each time there is a failure they say it is because there is not enough Europe. The British people have just said ‘stop. For us it’s the end. It’s over
1	Way to stack that audience with remainers typical channel 4
1	Great day for UK. Congratulations to make this decision. UK, now is free.
0	Boris Johnson is a twatt
1	I'm voting leave. As I see it my civil liberties are undemocratically  fucked two fold currently, I have the EU passing legislation I cannot  refute and I have HM Civil Service passing legislation I cannot refute,  I'd rather decrease the authoritative powers that be into a smaller  cluster, rather than creating Yugoslavia 2.0. Am I frightened of the  consequences of giving complete control to the fucktards that govern  Britain? Yes I am. Am I worried about initial repercussions to the  economy? Yes I am. But as it stands, what do we aspire to become within  the EU? Other countries like Switzerland and Norway have a GDP twice as  high. Perhaps I'm being optimistic but Britain has a trade surplus in  almost every service sector except tourism, we have the ability to do  well outside of the EU and smash the glass ceiling that is the EU  trading bloc. We have the potential, we are the world’s fifth largest  economy and fourth largest military power. One of only five countries  with a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. The WTO has driven  down trade tariffs and we'll be afforded the opportunity to import far  cheaper without European trade quotas cock blocking us and gain far more  access to international markets. In regards to immigration, it's not  something the fearmongers have frightened me with, but I CAN see it  pragmatically. The housing crisis (mostly private but some social) is  unable to sustain the type of numbers we are receiving now without an  influx from newly registered EU countries. I'm by no means a British  nationalist, I just think we can emulate other non EU European countries  to increase our standard of living.
1	I work in the development of power generation in the UK, my market was almost destroyed by EU red tape and misreading/interpretting of their own rules
1	Now : yeah          1 year later : nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
1	We didn't 'enjoy the benefits of membership'.  That's why we left.
1	bye bye EU,,YES TO BREXIT
1	No, and EU should stop trying to stop democracy. EU is looking like tyranny
0	Everyone know that Putin is behind this and probably Princess Meghan as well.
0	It's all just a big con job on the people, wait till we see what happens by the end of the year.
0	the state of NY - a hotbed of Liberalism put the death penalty on the books back in the 90s.  They never executed anyone.  But the rednecks upstate are thrilled it's a law.    &amp;#x200B;  so yeah-that's whats gonna happen with Brexit.
0	What an amazing grassroots #StopBrexit movement we’ve created! We have our work cut out for us. Never surrender, never give up!
0	So guernsey fisherman banned french boats from U.K. waters not realising they have to take their fish to France to be
0	Our side lost, our system is broken.
0	Brexit is the other face of the refugee crisis - tensions that lead to stasis, external risks that lead to asymmetric shocks.
1	Glad we left!
0	Is this a joke??? We now have border checks with numerous countries because of your #Brexit!
0	If you think about it #Brexit is an excellent weight loss program. Everyone in Britain is guaranteed to lose several pounds.
1	People of the UK, I congratulate you on your full freedom. You did it! So Mexico has its Cinco De Mayo and the United Kingdom has its 31st of January to celebrate. Make it a holiday with beers 🍻 and fill the pubs and be waving your Union Jacks for you have given hope to other nations in Europe to break away and reclaim their cultural identity. You even gave hope to us Apaches.
1	Dear brithish! If you can have a chance to vote then leave! The EU screwed over my country too when we joined. If there ever be a Huxit (Hungary), I will wote for leaving.
1	UK made itself great again!
0	I was 60-40 in favour of Remain. After Boris Johnson's ridiculous outburst comparing the EU to Hitler I'm now 100% #VoteStay #EUref
1	it's our country we need to sort us out PRIORITY.
1	They have lost their second biggest net contributor which is equal to 19 EU27 members combined and 16% of the EU economy simply because they were too arrogant to give Cameron even modest concessions.
1	The enemies of Great Britain have done a great job in perverting the minds of the younger generation. It is just what the Nazis did in Germany from the late 1920's in controlling the minds of a whole population. No wonder the young people voted against Brexit! Because of Left Wing teachers in Comprehensive schools, patriotism has become a dirty word and British history has been rewritten. They have succeeded in brainwashing the younger generation. This programme is an offence to any historian and should never be seen again.
1	Well done SIR NIGEL FARAGE.  So happy to see the traitors and snowflakes sob and cry their eyes out. I hope they weep for 3.5 years + interest.
1	Good, first step. Now go into the trade talks and do not for one moment let them dictate a thing to you. This country is behind you, you do not have to give an inch.
1	We have never had any real influence in the EU....another political mirage foisted on the UK public
1	The European Union was a bad idea from the beginning. Great Britain did the sensible thing!
1	Finally!! It's been dragging on forever
0	I don't think the British people really knew the ramifications of what would happen after Brexit or not.
0	Nigel Farage argued that, after Brexit, MPs will no longer be able to blame Brussels for what goes wrong in the country and that is "pretty exciting".
1	EU is so undemocratic!
1	Finaly, hopefully we can do things our way now, instead of taking orders from unelected asshats
0	Brits, what the hell are you doing?
0	Well, Brexit was never about supporting and helping UK citizens anyway.
0	I'm still European in my heart! I'm sad but I accept it because I have no other choice, but I will never be a British nationalist, I live in England and was raised in wales, Europe funded much of what gave me life and support, so it's in my life blood.
0	Absolutely! What a disgrace. One (maybe the only) silver lining of Brexit is that they’re no longer going to be there supposedly representing us!
0	No Danish bread on the shelf....? Hope not a sign of things to come
0	They sing for their deal, not real Brexit. They are stealing the money of British people.
0	This was a terrible decision and I think it would never pass if voted on again.
1	Specific examples would be the common agricultural policy which has seen food prices go up since we joined the EU in 1977 and honestly it has never gone back down.
0	This is actually sad
1	We don’t want to rejoin because nobody wants to be in a federal Europe.
1	So happy to nearly an independent nation again. We are more than a star on someone else's flag...
1	Excellent result! Boris looks like he's going for a proper Brexit as opposed to Theresa May's fudge that was like some kind of French farce or Leonardo Vinci opera. I shall be having a drink tonight to celebrate our victory.
0	Just remember, when it all goes pear shaped, you can't blame the EU for not playing ball, nothing says they have to, but according to the Tories, we've got them over a barrel.
0	I feel sad at the levels of Nationalistic celebrations, I am sure history will remember this day in a different light. On a positive note, Nigel Farage and his army of goon MEP's have now exited the EU parliament and will no longer let the British people down with their far right views and disrespect for the other members of the union.
0	Tell me. Why is membership of the EU preventing you from doing that?
1	What l want to know is when are they going to stop favouring muslims and start looking after their own.
1	It's about Damn time! Jolly good! Hip hip hurray!
1	Great job UK. Globalism is a failed idea. The world is safe when all nations are strong prosperous and self dependent
1	Goodbye and good riddance to E.U establishment. Reform or die.
0	"Getting Brexit Done". Strange logic, it's a bit like saying that you know you have to die sometime, so why not just commit suicide right now. Of course, in this case, that process will be a rather slow and painful death. Not in a ditch though, apparently.
1	Today is a good day. A great day. I'll savour every drop of remoaner tear. Cry me a river.31.01.2020 #BrexitDay
1	We control the money! Yippee!
1	40 years of slavery to a corrupt EU gone.
1	another panel of ""so-called-experts"" every time that remoaners try and demonise Brexit or the Brexit negotiations or put Boris down they always claim its by a ""panel of experts"" and mostly its just ""one person's opinion"" one self important up their own ares's personal opinion, and rarely has anything to back it up with, just words and opinions ""nothing else"" and they're so arrogant that they think everyone should listen to them and hang on every word ""but people are not that stupid""
1	Why can't you people just Exit already. YOu voted on the thing two years ago and you're still fighting about it.
1	GOOD. the UK now has its nation back.
0	UK leaves the most wealthy club on the globe to keep the lowest life of standard
0	I just curious to know how uk will strive economically after this
0	The campaign to #Rejoin starts today.
1	The EU is like the 'mob' in TV dramas like the Sopranos. It is always about the money.
0	The two thirds of immigrants are from outside the EU and the government has a full control of the numbers. Why haven't they used  their power to do something about it? Now we are leaving the EU and putting hundreds of thousands of jobs on the line.
1	i never voted for what the eu has become
1	Eu cherry picking. Let them pay for a yearly, quota based, licence
0	EU should make visas for British citizens
1	Britons! Vote for sovereignty and self determination! Not plutocratic bureaucrats in Brussels!
1	We won’t be part of a ever growing growing political and controlling “union”.
0	Waking up this morning, it is heartbreaking to see my news feed is full of thoroughly dejected people. Most of these are young, intelligent and passionate, individuals who were determined to support integration, tolerance and compassion. Yet, our futures have been governed by the votes of narrow-minded older generations who now will sit back and see our bright futures dimmed. I am embarrassed and disappointed that our country has been manipulated by the xenophobic, racist and above all incorrect facts that have been spread. Nigel Farage stated that leaving the EU is a victory for the ordinary, decent people – today I am proud to be exceptionally indecent.
0	Brexit is a stupid and reckless act by small-minded British people desperately clawing on to some mis-remembered notion of sovereignty.
0	Boris ignoring the fact that people will suffer.   That's what a lot of the working class voted for.
1	So proud of Britain....congratulations for your leading role in the end of globalism
0	The so called 'unleashing' stuff could have all been done whilst in EU. Such deliberately misleading rubbish. We already had the power/sovereignty to do all that stuff, including manage immigration as part of EU. There was no leash.
0	Basically boris man bad
1	I honestly thought by the headline I was going to learn what’s next! What a waste of an article
0	Does Britain realise it’s been fucked? You still have to pay EU contributions but don’t have a say in the EU. Boris really sold this as a win in the country?
1	No. And they won't have any say AT ALL in our legislation either.
0	I can't believe how much misinformation is in this comment section... It's really sad but apparently people is against international cooperation and that leads to war.
1	We do NOT want continued instructions off the EU. We do NOT want level playing fields as that takes away the benefits of being a FREE and independent COUNTRY again. We can sustain a few blips after we gain our freedom in Dec 2020. It is NOT our responsibility to pay in yet more money into the EU to save Germany, Italy and Greece from recession and the EU from possible collapse.
0	You said Brexit was about patriotism, democracy & 'the will of the people' 'take back control'. I thought it was just about how much loot you lot could rake in, as your sister said. But it's REALLY to evade scrutiny of EU courts so you lot can grab power free from HoC or UK Laws.
0	the fall of UK start
0	47% of the UK population are capable of studing data and making an informed decision based off facts and figures... the rest is not.Goodbye EU your world leading standards in food, workers rights, environment and human rights will me missed.
1	The Mad man did it. Now Britain will no longer suffer from the dysfunctional and undemocratic EU.
1	Finally they get to leave bureaucracy of the EU and return to the loving and sweat free embrace of the monarchy.
0	This is becoming more amusing by the day. I can't believe an entire country fell for this nonsense.
1	I don't like free movement of people into the UK. I've made a fuck load trading currency, and will have no problems emigrating anywhere in Europe because of my skillset.
0	Thats what happens when ...
1	“The EU is enormously powerful.” This is exactly why you leave if you value sovereignty.
0	I hope sovereignty will give ppl a job and put food on the table.  All that will be harder with Brexit as the country becomes poorer.
1	yes
0	If he is the British representative then I’m sure the EU will be happy for UK to leave. I’m confident he does not speak, or act for a majority of British people.
1	The only mistake was that we did not walk away 3 years ago.
1	Is it only me that realizes we are actually still adhering to the rules we agreed to when we were members of the EU but now we have no say in those rules yet we still adhere to them until we leave the EU.
1	3 YEARS TOO LATE.  DEAL WITH IT YOU SALTY BITCHES YOU LOST.  TIME TO MOVE ONWARDS AND UPWARDS.  IF YOU HATE THIS COUNTRY JUST FUCK OFF AND LEAVE.
0	Rule Britannia again
0	Britains most idiotic self inflicted economic wound led by the most appropriate buffoon of a leader ....knock yourselves out Britain
1	Brexit is simple and harmless.
1	This is hilarious were leaving...accept it. Psychologically filling the gaps with negative connotation will not stop this great nation leaving the dictatorship.
1	Who cares what the EU says about us? The important fact is that we were suitably intelligent to see that being a contributor (never legally a member per international law) was a pure waste of time, effort and money. Our leaving will in future come to bring benefits beyond our wildest dreams.
0	It does seem that the people of Britain have changed their minds and no longer want Brexit. Not to mention its implications for ordinary people - the NHS will go, for a start.
1	Soon the EU will collapse just like the USSR.
1	I'm French and live in UK and i've always waiting for this moment
0	We must respond to Brexit with more than yelling
1	liberal metropolitan elites finally get their comeuppance
0	😆 it's funny, when the brits sees the raise in taxes for the commercial negotiations they will want to be back to EU or begin piracy endeavours as they always did before the ww2. they feel really "independent" but the only reason they did this is because papa USA allow this.
0	Literally no one in Scotland voted for Brexit...
1	UK is too big, needs no one. Uk gonna make huge deals with the world, make a lot of money
0	the only thing i actually like about brexit is the blue passport
0	I've said it since the vote in 2016 I believe Brexit will lead to the break up of Britain Scotland and northern Ireland  will leave Britain and I don't see Brexit ending well for anyone but its democracy so we need to except the vote and move forward I hope Brexit works out but I don't think it will unfortunately.
1	I am packing my things
1	Finally, all countries should leave the EU
0	Dumb move, being made dumber by how they're going about it.
0	I though it was dumb at first (or at least too soon to do it), but after having voted yes, they should have just left instead of keeping it in a state of brextension. The longer they kept it up, the less negotiating power they have.
0	it sounds very stupid to leave the eu
1	There was a majority to leave. Seems that is the one that counts.
1	give that EU vacant seat from post-england to Ukraine who much deserves it
1	The EU is a scourge upon humanity. Disband it.
1	The EU are desperate and are not to be trusted. If they dictate to us we should just walk away.
1	Boris will go down along with Churchill as the greatest PM this country has ever had. What a time to be alive. I've had an extra spring in my step these last few days.
0	Good Lord! Just STOP BREXIT! It’s painfully obvious that it’s the right thing to do! Enough already! Why must a democratic, free thinking people hurl themselves over a cliff? Mature adults can see that a course needs to be changed, once circumstances change, and once data proves that it was not a good idea. They just say:  “On second thought, NO - based on what we know now, and where we are.”
0	Brexit propaganda is just that: propaganda. There is very little truth  in any of it. It is not even particularly good propaganda. As to why  anybody would believe anything that Boris the Liar says, that is  completely beyond me. Ho-hum, some people are about to learn who is big and strong and tough, and who is little and weak and not so tough.
0	Brexit day? I call it doomsday.
0	Britains most idiotic self inflicted economic wound led by the most appropriate buffoon of a leader ....knock yourselves out Britain
1	Well done Britain we will prosper  Good to see the commonwealth coming back together too. God save our queen 😍😘
1	More Irish on the EU gravy train
0	What really stresses me out though is that the UK has really unrealistic expectations of what can be done in this one year
1	Blow them out of the water! Rule Brittania!
1	A brilliant summing up Sir. However, as we seem to have been infiltrated by millions who do NOT have our interests at heart, & children  have been brainwashed that our History is crap, there must be a huge effort to clamp fown on these abominations. Beware of the third column!!!
0	Scotland want to be free from one foreign government so that they can go running off to be ruled by another? Wtf ðŸ˜‚
1	Get it bloody done !! if parliament try stop it kick them where it hurts!!!!
1	The strange thing is not that Britain is leaving EU - it's that we ever joined.
1	Thank goodness Boris won election. Never hear from that squeaky Swinson woman anymore, no doubt looking for a job in the EU
1	Congrats Britain! Now clean up the refugee problem and you will resolve the Knife and Rape problem you have, first get Khan the Con out of office, he should be locked up along with the fake news that covers up the crime.
0	Breixters  will be telling us it's all in our heads, after 3 years of evidence and  expert opinion on how things are going to go for many years at the  least.level 2
1	I’m so excited for the future surely now we are going to be the country we once was! Independent self-governing country! I love Europe and all the people that are in it you are welcome but we don’t want no criminals we’ve got enough over here as it is haha I love Europe but hate the European Union! Rule Britannia..... Britain shall never be slaves......
0	What will happen after BREXIT? We will move to France and apply for asylum.
0	the British government know very well how things are in the EU because they were member, now you're Out and want Things for Free 😂😂😁😁 funny brits
1	Thank God, we have finally left. Our country and sovereignty will be reinstated.
0	Devastating for the country I love.
1	What's wrong with waving your countries flag    the European union is a toxic  globalism organisation trying to kill sovereignty and national identity    down with the union
0	Send for the men in white coats! #LiarJohnson #ToryBrexit
1	Congratulations to the UK people, Nigel Farage, and Boris Johnson for finally doing BREXIT. Theresa May said it was impossible. Why couldn't she get it done?
0	For my birthday this year I got #Brexit. If I don't get my mad superpower like those kids in Midnight's Children pretty soon, then I will not be happy. Because, so far, all it has brought me is a lot of paperwork. #BrexitDay
1	No more money from UK go to EU corrupted organisation ever again !!!!!!!bye
0	I am LibDem voter who wants to #StopBrexit
0	Unfortunately 17.4m people voted to leave, The Conservatives were returned to power with a majority. If the will of the country was to remain then we'd have seen a Labour Government or a coalition of remain parties. By defination a majority of the country didn't want to remain.
1	Lol, now please fail quietly.
1	Great news! Good job!
0	I’m not afraid with a no-deal Brexit. GB looses, EU doesn’t.
1	I am a socialist and believe in democracy, and my main sticking point was the secret TTIP discussions and I was fearful for our NHS. I am an EU national as well as a British citizen, and I also didn’t like the lies from the remain camp telling us that our workers’ rights exist only because of the EU. Trade unions fought for our rights as they have always done.  We need to hold our politicians accountable and vote them out if necessary. We can now choose how we spend our own nation’s money and not be given our pocket money like children. We can decide who we trade with. We shall decide the terms of that trade by negotiation. We shall set our own agenda. We shall be able to keep our public services and not be forced to privatise them, and if we choose we can re-nationalise our industries which would not be allowed in the EU.  I didn’t like the way remain were continuously trying to imply that anyone who didn’t agree with them must fit the media’s narrative that a leave voter is a rightwing bigot. I believe in every country determining its own fate and I have always supported nations claiming independence for its own people. Why are we considered bigots or racists for wanting to make our own decisions for our own country?  Whatever the long-term outcome for our country, I believe in freedom and self-determination. I hope we can get over the divisions and work together to find our identity once again. What kind of a nation we want to become will be decided by us, and we shall succeed or fail by our own efforts as a nation together.  I have been truly shocked and saddened by the vitriol spewing from members of the remain camp, especially the younger voters who have even suggested that the right to vote should be withdrawn from older people who disagree with them. What great advocates for democracy!
0	Silver lining, ten years down the line might be a vote to rejoin
0	I haven't met any racist remain voters.   Just like I've met plenty of leave voters who aren't racist.
1	The British econemy would shrink really ? Maybe for ashort period of time, we import Billions more than we exportto the EU, only an idiot would dismiss the disasterous effect on other European countries if they did not trade with us.
1	The only mistake the EU made, .was to exist !.
0	It's a sad day. Those who voted for it will either be rich enough to survive OK .. or .. they'll be too poor to cope with the increased prices etc. Those who voted to remain as Europeans are scrabbling to find solutions; the rich will be fine of course but once again the poor will be right up against it.
1	In ten years time, when people see what is happening in a federalised Europe, they will be glad that we removed ourselves.
1	Trending now and forever more: #leavetheeufast
0	I’m disgusted. Utterly and completely disgusted with my country and what they have done to my future. I’m 16 years old and therefore didn’t vote on this matter, which incidentally I’m also absolutely furious about. The fact that people who are going to be gone in the next 10 years were allowed to vote on something that my peers and I have to live with for the rest of our lives is completely and utterly unacceptable.  I’m disgusted with the way the campaigns have been carried out and the fear-mongering that has taken place. I’m disgusted that this country are so fearful of immigration and the outside world they would cut themselves off entirely from any connections we may previously have had.  But most of all, I’m scared. I’m terrified. I’m terrified for my future, and what that may bring. I’m terrified that we live in a country of racists and bigots and that young people will have to live with their mistakes. I’m terrified that we are governed by a group of disgusting, rightwing, racist trolls who couldn’t care less about what young people have to say. I’m terrified that this is the country I live in, and this is the choice that they have made.
1	Poverty..... welcome in uk
1	Bye EUSSR
0	The lot of them will miss the EU gravy train especially the Kinnocks
1	We are bogged down with the rest of the world, most of them don’t like English people,so it’s time to leave
0	being inside EU is beneficial for trading within Europe.
1	I'm an American, but it was very interesting watching this from the outside. Go Britain. Nationalism for the win!
0	I don’t know anymore!!!! UK can do very well with Europeans instead of standing alone!!!
1	Good for Britain. Brexit is just like 1776 for America
1	Wonderful news. Congratulations on securing a future for Britons, not paying for the rest of the EU.
1	And winning Brexit with associated sallty remoaner tears It's a team sport, their team won, and that's it, we dont see it as a team sport. We're not both seeing the same "reality"
1	the remainers and the BBC will still be wining and wringing there hands come monday
0	This country is going down the drain while the tories squabble like a bunch of school kids.
0	So the EU has goods the UK want to buy and the UK has money the EU want....hmmmm.      This is a real head scratcher.
1	if the majority are supposed to be pro-EU how come we have so many Anti-EU MEP's?
0	Too bad Scotland’s vote wasn’t counted. I pray Northern Ireland’s border will be peaceful still.
0	Well welcome to the start of everyone becoming poor
1	For many euro-skeptics, it’s a sign that maybe leaving the EU isn’t such a good idea. For pro-europeans, it’s a sign that the will of the people can no longer be done without. This should encourage both sides to more constructive criticism and reform of the EU rather than radical dogmatism, and that’s excellent.
0	If you are wondering what Brexit will be like, just try imagining a perfect Christmas, but where you are the turkey.
0	"The British are too big to bully." Really showing just how much you care about the other three countries you just dragged out of the EU with you.
1	...but if they lose, they will AGAIN refuse to accept the electoral result and resort to violence like unhinged Leftists always do....
0	Good luck UK! Youre on your own. It will be a mess one way or another.
0	Brexit has a new meaning, it now means........ LEAVE BRITAIN, LEAVE THE UK.
1	If Brits are smart, they should start strengthening economic ties with the commonwealth countries rather than political ties.
1	What a great #Brexitday
1	Leave would have got fisheries, farming, ability to strike trade deals, out of the ECJ etc etc
1	I wish the media would stop making it out that everyone in Scotland is against brexit because I and many others are so happy to be out.
1	I'm glad we left
1	God bless you freedom lovers everywhere!!! Congratulations!!!
0	Disparate countries do better if there is a common framework within which to operate, otherwise one is in a race to the bottom in terms of one's workforce
1	Unfortunately the media and all the luvvies were remoaners it will be their pathetic little stance ! Doesn’t change the fact we’re out the world hasn’t imploded and the interest rates are held in anticipation of an upturn in the economy !
0	So Bye, Bye made the Globalist cry
0	UK economy suffers so do we all How are we going to invest In NHS public services ect.
0	They watched our country install Trump we get to watch them do this. Both huge stupid moves.
0	If it were up to me, the UK would remain in a reformed EU.
1	Leaving the EU is a victory for British,
0	Just a quick reminder that exiting EU was the easy part of this whole endeavor, and it took them 3 years to do it. Now the somehow need to negotiate the biggest, most comprehensive trade deal in the world in just 11 months.
1	Walls come tumbling down
1	When Brexit won, I smiled the whole day
0	Buy British would result in starvation of half of the Brits.
0	Brexit benefits? None. None whatsoever.
1	Just needs to give the impression of one, actually. They won't be interested in the details.
0	ECONOMIC SUICIDE.........🤢🤮
1	wow Britain made a smart decision to leave the refugee union
1	Celebrations 👍
1	RULE BRITAINNA
0	Brexit will ruine the UK
1	The Withdrawal Agreement has received Royal Assent and is now law. We will leave the EU on January 31st 🇬🇧
1	Happy Brexit to all proper Brits!
0	Should have read the small print, Brexit comes with reams of it.
0	Count down to the end of UK herself. Scotland will seperate from UK, Ireland will reunite. No UK, no more Great Britain, only England. A country smaller than the size of Tunisia """""""WON'T"""""" be a """"GREAT""'" anything. It will only be an overseas territory of the USA. 😂
0	It's official: Brexit Britain is a laughing stock.
0	Today is a sad day. The UK has been a bit of a second home for me for years now. I lived in Edinburgh when the referendum happened. I've come to London to see theatre and to make theatre again and again while the Brexit date was pushed back again and again. Today feels unreal.
1	I voted leave for all these reasons. Hopefully now we have a new government we can make Great Britain great again. 🇬🇧🇬🇧
0	Alot of buissness left the UK.
1	NO NO NO, WE ARE OUT - Great deal for us or NO DEAL!!!!
0	NO BREXIT!
0	Fuck you Boris and fuck you Farage!
0	Can you quantify how the EU needs us more than we need them? In all sectors of the economy, please. With the government's own figures as to the consequences of No Deal, especially number of jobs lost #BrexitLies
1	There will be little left of the EU in 20 years time.
0	Britain looks just like my cats - standing in the doorway, not knowing whether they should come in or go out
1	It seems like the UK was always one foot out of the EU, but separating completely still perplexes many.
1	Britain should leave the European Union alone
1	Remainers??? Move to France..just wild guess
0	In the first PMQS since Brexit day Boris Johnson lied unchecked to MP’s about the economy.
1	The working class of this country should remember as long as we have open borders your wages will be suppressed the last 10 years has proved that
1	Keglanek 🇬🇧 are going to be fine don’t your worry about that
0	To achieve very dodgy deals with the likes of the U.S. which will massively benefit the small section of the country as represented by ERG to the detriment of the majority of the population.
0	The UK is only the fifth economic in the world, thanks to the EU and all their free trade agreements with other countries and the big common market within the EU. The all gone lose these advantages now.
0	Damn... so it's finally happening. It feels weird somehow... Definitely  one of those historic moments. All problems aside, it's definitely a sad  moment for the project EU and for Europe as a whole. The Union isn't  perfect and it definitely needs reforms in certain aspects, but the  concept as such is a big achievement and we should fight to keep it  going. Together we stand, divided we fall.
1	One plus of Brexit is that Farage no longer has the European Parliament as a platform and source of funds, which he used to great effect for 20 years. The great irony of UKIP & the Brexit party is that they were funded and promoted by the EU itself. This will now stop
0	England will pay an incredibly high price for this wrong decision. #brexit
0	Big Ben was too expensive so we get an recording with a projector. Says everything about brexit.
0	If intelligent people with experience and insight are to be believed GDP, National Debt, Poverty, Zero Hours Contracts, Employment Rights, Unemployment (the real sort, not the comedy figures BloJo proports) are going to get a lot worse over the next few years. Still, at least we got blue passports and have enough control that we can only blame ourselves for the forthcoming clusterfuck. Unless it's all the EU's fault, like before.
1	Viva La Brexit
1	Congratulations on this massive win, from Holland! UK leading by example once again. Once Europe's final bastion, and again a beacon of hope. Hope to see you on the other side. Thoroughly enjoy! People, do tease those remoaner colleagues at the coffee machine at work tomorrow.
0	Brexit is a con which takes rights, protections and freedoms away from the British public and offers them nothing in return. We all deserve better.
0	EU is far more democratic then the UK . Wales , NI & Scotland have nothing to say , only England matters .House of lords = a bunch of non elected old men. House of common : The voting system : the winner takes it all is from the middle ages ( the knights !) only good for 1 party , the others have nothing ... democratic is a weird word in the UK.
0	Zero tariffs? Lol.  Good luck.
0	Today we leave the EU - one of the world's biggest and most successful single markets. We start losing the freedom to live, study or work in Europe. We exit rules which cleaned our beaches, made our living standards better, stopped us working long hours, defined better rest periods and delivered over 50 years of peace, stability and prosperity. The media told us about "mad EU rules" that, in reality, our British MEP's voted on and accepted. They told us about blue passports which we could've had all along. They told us about the "uncontrolled migration" which, in reality, was allowed because our own government didn't apply EU migration rules properly. In charge, Boris Johnson - the man who lost a quarter of a million buying a water cannon. The gate is open and the horse has bolted. Good luck everyone.
0	This is so funny worldwide everyone is laughing at England about this
1	we are back on track as a free nation and democracy
1	You lot moan about the state of Britain, when it's been ruled for 40 years by the corrupt EU! Moron.
0	This is the UK decay
1	Got my EU flag, ready to burn it on the 31st January.
1	Congratulations UK! I do hope many more will follow
1	Leave. I don't want to be ruled by an unelected elite in a federal europe
0	Johnson warned Japanese trade deal hangs on Brussels agreement  -RTing this because it matters very much for our economy, -though you'd have to have been living under a rock for it to come as actual NEWS. #StopBrexit It's a scam set up by tax avoiders.
0	I think that Boris Johnson is an imbecile, that Theresa May should have held a second referendum, that Article 50 should have stipulations added for requiring two public votes for exit to occur, and that Great Britain is looking like it's about to just be 'Britain' once again.  Given how close the Scottish Independence vote was, back when Brexit was just an idea, I'm not surprised in the slightest that they've decided to hold a referendum once again, for the sake of remaining in the EU.  One thing I seriously believe might be the only good solution for NI right now is for them to vote for their independence from the UK, however they should remain their own nation inside of the EU, free to make trade deals with England as they see fit. It'd be too much to ask them to formally be absorbed into the Republic of Ireland like Sinn Féin has been pushing for decades. That's what I think is the only fair compromise that doesn't outright break the Good Friday agreement. Though the good Friday agreement doesn't specifically allow for NI to vote for complete independence of both parties, I would interpret a majority vote to leave the UK, and a vote to not unify would be valid under the agreement, I don't know too much about how strict or loose an interpretation of an agreement that old is allowed to be, so please correct me if I'm wrong about my interpretation.
0	Leavers are a cult. Exactly the same as the Trump followers
0	Yippie! Let's embrace poverty, high American health insurance and expensive medication. How a once great nation is going to the dogs.
0	Time will show us the truth of brexit. And it will not be pretty.
1	too late for tears mrs EU!! Be nice to your members next time!!
0	Does this mean the UK won't be able to receive certain foods anymore?
0	I've talked to my SO's family from the UK (he immigrated as a child and  most of his family still lives there). They have all stated they are  incredibly worried about the economic impact that leaving the EU would  have.
1	The people have finally decided.
1	So many EU bootlickers, let me tell you that EU was so upset about brexit and you know why? Because they lost a wallet.
1	Congratulations to my British friends across the pond. I applaud you for regaining your independence, being your own people and the sole rulers of your own country. We Americans wish you years of prosperity and peace, and again, congratulations
0	Even though I'm against Brexit it is SO HARD to take them serious when their crowd is made up of white haired tooth-pierced freshman activists
0	Soon Britain won't even be a kingdom.
1	Thank God for his one nation conservative government. Finally the Brits are free.
0	The Brits will pay the price for this election probably ending the loss of stature just like the U.S.
0	it's going to buttfuck the UK. How can they not see that?
0	Brexit is what happens when you make decisions sorely based on xenophobia, racism, bigotry and zero intelligence.
1	As a, leaver, immigrant( who never got any hate apart from from #remoaners who labelled me racist and xenophobic without knowing me & therefore showed THEIR racism) I'm proud of my adopted country taking back its own destiny.
1	So happy for English people.. They re the best of the best... I m from Italy and I made party too. I hope my people do the same. I'm tired to be a slave of German and French government.. We were so happy before this union... We didn't need to find a job overseas... Great Job England... You are inspiring.
1	Good job Great Britain. Congratulations
1	Thanks God that we finally got rid of EU
1	Every English person: yes we’ve finally left
0	Johnson thinks he’s Churchill, but history will place him below Anthony Eden for him weakening the UK. From making up stories about the EU as a lazy journalist to the lying Leave campaign, Tory civil war and stupid election slogan, Johnson is Brexit and all that follows from it.
1	Well, here we are. Time to move on as a country and look at other issues
0	#Brexit, the most pointless, masochistic ambition in our country's history, is done
1	I went out yesterday and no one mentioned Brexit at all. The sun had come up, there was water in the taps, electricity at the sockets, and prescription drugs were freely available. I expect the same will happen at the closure of the trade deal in a years time. Life goes on, but you wouldn't believe it from some of the comments on social media and in the DT.
1	Good to hear it. Glory to God alone in Jesus most holy name. MAKE THE UK GREAT AGAIN!!! AMEN.
0	Brexit means trade war!
1	Free at last, Free at Last...
0	It curbs the ability of large multinationals to profiteer via divide-and-conquer. If they are selling good at price A in Spain and price B (half of A) in France, Spanish customers can go to France and buy the goods without any comeback.
1	Good. EU has a lot of issues.
1	Roll of 2017 with the big fat yes to get out. lets leave the eu and not end up like Greece.
0	Can Boris Johnson refund me and thousands of expats the money lost from my pension (converted to euros) due to the pound devaluing after the #Brexit vote, of which he was an instigator? Only then he can carry on bullshitting.
1	Keep the fishing rights!! They should not be on the table at all!!
1	I dont understand, there is no debate to be had here. The majority voted, end of story. 2nd referendum? Voting until you get the result that you want is not democracy
1	EU want to extend to keep UK money coming in . It'll be over four years since the vote , ....we're leaving Dec.31st ......ready or not EU , it's bye bye
0	This is absolutely true, but after Brexit, anti-Corbynism and utter right wing bias on Question Time and the Today programmes it will be an uneasy alliance
1	The EU will be lucky if the UK gives them a few scraps to fight over.
1	we will be back in the hands of this great country.
1	Run as fast as we can and don't look back...
1	You Europeans really have to stop this the UK is breaking up rubbish, far from it didn’t you hear the DUP speech. Also we have a 61% deficit with the EU also the EU will lose it’s biggest military asset .
0	How? The reality is that British people will lose a lot of freedoms.
1	Democracy represents everyone. The losers in a general election don’t pack up and go home.
0	I'm just curious how the UK will negotiate with the EU by the end of the year when they don't even know what they want
1	Democratic UK will thrive and move ahead economically against the undemocratic EU bureaucracy fools.
1	Happy days well done boris
0	We will rejoin and it will be great!
1	The monumental mistake would be staying in and losing the United Kingdom. Cameron is a traitor to his Queen & country
0	UK had immigrants before EU , and migration will cintinue even after EU!Congratulations!
0	The problems we have in the UK are self-inflicted not by the EU. Leaving the EU will not alter the stupidity of our political class and their economic failures. The economic benefits of exit are probably marginal either way, and the only real benefit will be emotional for those who are strongly nationalist. Most of the arguments for and against are hysteria or lies.
1	Parliament didn't vote to leave. The British people did.  The British people are not in charge of the progress of brexit. Parliament is.  It is obvious that Parliament has no desire to honor the vote. They are dragging their feet and purposely dragging it out to make everyone miserable enough to just say "fine, cancel it."  Absolutely fucking disgusting.
1	the british MP in the EU parliament who cried, did so because she now lost her job.......ha ha
1	It’s great that Brits are getting their country back!
0	BOZO claims he will unite the country, just another of his blatant lies. He is the last person who could do this. Even Farage or Widdecombe would have a better chance!! The majority in UK are now pro-EU and we will never yield to the Toffs, the fascists and the ignorant who are currently in control.
0	Well, I can only agree with you Simon.Well, I can only agree with you. But maybe the better idea would have been to fight Brexit when it was still possible?
0	That's stupid as hell and since other EU countries start considering to leave now that GB is setting an example we're getting worried about the EU falling apart and war ensuing again.
0	A lot of people are shaking their heads now.
1	It makes sense to get out. Why would the Britain want the rest of Europe telling them what to do? I cant stand when people try to tell me what to do.
1	UK will thrive and EU will collapse. the only thing that can hold UK back is negativity. Boot out anyone who shows negativity and make our country GREAT again.
1	This was interesting but slightly naive. The EU exports far more to us than we export to them. If they don't do a deal and 10% tariffs go up in both directions they lose out. That's why they've said they don't want "unfair competition" from us, because they can't handle competition. The UK economy is as big as 18 EU countries combined.
1	Yes get out as soon as possible, we were once a great country, not anymore
1	This is not an end, but a beginning.
1	The 5 million Brits who emigrated are free to speak English to their partners or family.
1	Why is anyone annoyed by this? Patriots are standing up and unified as a country. Thatâ€™s a great thing. I love when I see that in the U.S.
0	god bless britian
0	My Remainer friends. You have been venting now for nearly 4 years and ultimately to no avail. We are now out of the EU. We have a government with a huge majority that will run until the end of 2024. All of your rantings are doing nothing but harm to your health. Give it up. Accept the inevitability of leaving and putting the UK first rather than bowing to EU overlords. You will feel all the better
0	I love Brits, snobbery and all but I think they're going to learn a hard lesson, here.
0	The core points of the Brexit campaign are:    to stop giving money to the EU when we could spend it instead.  To stop foreigners coming in and taking low paid jobs and houses, also using the NHSTo generally make Britain more economically independent and able to set terms on trade and employment law. To return Britain to the way was in the past. Independent, self governing and financially strong.   My problems with these:    we pay money to be in a club, like being a member of a Gym, you pay  money to use the facilities. Now imagine we get a vote on the gyms  direction - want more hot yoga or kettlebells, we get a vote . The  assumption that "Norway and Switzerland do it alone" , in fact they also  pay to use the facilities but they don't get any say on policy. We do.  EU migrants - if we still want full trading access to the EU region  the migration laws are the exact same. If the UK had the same net EU  immigration rate as Switzerland, it would mean nearly 400,000 more EU  migrants a year! Any workers in Britain pay taxes, and that rightfully  gives access to the NHS.  To dictate trade terms with (lets say) China or USA, we must  determine relative economy values. The balance of trade. Currently we  trade on equal terms with them, as part of a large trading bloc. If we  separate then our trade ratio gives us terrible negotiating power."make Britain Great again!" the 50s, 60s and 70s in Britain were  socially grim and our financial situation was very dire.  We now live in  a global mega corporate world, financial institutions now run public  policy across borders. we are at the mercy of corporate interests but  It's easier for them to bully a loner than a gang. Rupert Murdoch has  admitted exactly this - he can bully the UK govt. but not the EU.  Tl;dr - Remain
1	Goodbye and be proud of your flagNo shame here ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§
1	The EU was a bad idea from day one!!
0	So every moron Brexiter wants to hang the GOSH nurse because of what she said and wish cancer on this one? You're all disgusting idiots
1	All I wanted was to leave you EU and the government keeps messing it up so a hard brexit and then move forward form there.
1	Thanks Momentum, you got us out of the EU good-style.
1	consequences, but also enjoy the benefits of independence
0	The UK deserves this. They had an election and an opportunity to prevent  this.  They didn’t care. They let the conservative old minority dictate  policy for long after they’ll be gone.
1	You can blame the Remoaners for this one. Their fault parliament was preoccupied with Brexit three years after we should have left.
0	EU has higher ideals than any of its member states, that's my perception. Environmental wise, human rights wise, etc. Full of those 'liberals' most Brexiteers hate so much. That’s why I like it. How Brexiteers managed to turn it into the very opposite of what it actually is - quite an PR achievement
0	i believe that leaving is fundamentally the wrong thing to do
1	Riots in the street, recession, no medicines, airplanes not flying - enough about France. I thought those outcomes were forecasted for the UK?
1	Wake me up when it is all over and the UK is back on top of the world.
1	i guess the blue on the flag is not happy about it!
1	I wanted out of the European Union because I knew it would be best for how I wanted Britain.
1	Give the EU the big middle finger by calling President Trump and hammering out a deal within a week.
1	Oh joy of joys were out of that undemocratic fascist deceiving organization known as the eu
1	I could not be happier for the people of Great Britain.  Freedom always makes me smile.
1	Boris has a vision and he's a winner. WTO will do just fine.
0	Brexit is the single biggest misstep in British history, brought about by self-seeing charlatans, and voted in by sheep.
1	Congratulations to the British People who prevailed in taking  back their Sovereignty. Britain has a Proud History and a Promising Future           #Brexit #UK
1	It is over for the EU.
0	With how much of a clusterfuck brexit has been so far, it's more likely to serve as a warning to member nations.
0	We voted to leave the EU based on a tissue of lies promulgated by the serial liar and serial incompetent Johnson.The reason for his lying had nothing to do with the EU and everything to do with his ambition to become PM. Well the got his wish and now is payback time because he is entirely clueless as to what to do next. The country has been destroyed purely because of his personal ambition.
0	Britain is one of the most important countries in EU . Britain is very important for EU development and for the most for our democracy .
0	I hope the people of the north, especially the traditional manufacturing, mining towns etc, get the brexit they deserve and I've got a feeling that's exactly what's about to happen.They will only have themselves to blame unfortunately.
1	Well done sir!!
0	#Brexit: What does it mean for UK pensioners living in Europe? All you need to know is that things will be WORSE than before & to date no one has shown any evidence for genuine benefits outweighing genuine advantages in #Remain-ing a full member.
0	I’m confused.   It was voted for by the majority of the country within a very slim margin. Your parliament can’t seem to agree on a plan to move forward all these years later. There have been 2  prime ministers and now an election that will influence the representation in parliament and Brexit.   And you all are just standing by watching as pending non-EU citizens.  Is that kind of right ?
1	Will the EU start paying us for access to our markets? With such a huge trade imbalance they should.
1	Staying in the EU is not in the interest of any nation of Europe but Britain seems to be the only one strong enough to decide it’s time to leave before we go crashing down with the rest of the member states and their vulnerable, weak Euro.
0	Hope The Scottish & Irish Do not Take to Long To Implement Their Independence !
1	Applicants must have the unrestricted right to live and work in the EU.” British only nationality not good enough.
0	Enjoy traveling to and from! What a bunch of morons.
0	It was and still is a terrible idea poorly executed
1	The purpose of the EU may well have originally been to counter that power, (though I doubt that to have been entirely the case), but, in any event, as any structure grows larger so it grows less accountable and more corruptible.
0	The UK and the British (who let things happen or actively made things happen, depending on the way you look at it) are beyond help, and a lot of nasty things are going to happen there, all of which the majority of the population there will be extremely happy with, as it is precisely what they voted for. As said, beyond help, but even if that were not the case and help might still be possible, that help should NOT be given. The EU must stay out of it, even if only to make a point. One cannot help someone who doesn´t want toe be helped, and who is not willing to accept responsibility, someone who ALWAYS blames some other party for whatever happens. What the EU SHOULD urgently do, though, is take every possible precaution to safely protect itself from the UK and from what is happening there. We have come to long a way to allow ourselves to be thrown back into barbarous times, into quasi feudal situations, into situations from a past that should NEVER come back....Those times have long gone!
0	Dang it were out now
0	when the welcomed,cash injections to the poorest places in UK, suddenly stop, that's when stuff will hit the fan.
1	I'm proud Brexiteer and am even more determined now than I was on referendum day.
0	The far-rights attempts to destroy the UK continues. Fuck BoBo the Clown, fuck Brexiteers
1	conomic plan wont work without cheap EU immigrant labour keeping wages low. #Brexit. End UK slavery
0	Love to hear what these fools have to say now,looking at the state of the parliament! Do they still want to leave😂
1	I see the ‘planes are still flying. Local supermarket still full of food.  Restaurants in post-Brexit London still packed on a Saturday night.  Do you suppose the doom-mongers who said Leaving the EU would bring ruin are feeling just a little foolish?
1	I can already see us all coming together! It's a truly beautiful spectacle!!!
1	Good , WE VOTED TO LEAVE . goodbye .
1	EU will disband very soon. Completely bankrupt within 5 years.
1	God bless the UK.  God bless USA.  God bless Nigel Farage.  God bless Donald Trump.  Trump 2020.  MAGA
1	the EU is nothing but a waste of taxpayers money. those bureaucrats have abused their position only to enrich themselves and their sponsors instead of looking out for european interests. im glad britain voted out and i hope the rest of will too.
0	As a remainer, I accept the result but I would vote remain again. Simply because the EU does not effect my life negativity. I am still yet to hear anyone explain to me why the EU is so bad and how it affects their lives negatively. Yes, I’ve heard all the same sound bites and regurgitated headlines but no explanation of how that is effecting peoples lives directly. Hope it all works out.
1	things were perfectly fine before they joined the EU and it will be perfectly fine after they aren’t part of the EU.
0	Britain is the kid in elementary school that eats glue
0	The inescapable logic of the UK leaving a supranational project is for the separate nations of the UK to also go it alone. Brexit was fuelled mainly by English nationalism, and Brexiters have to own the natural outcomes of their logic.
0	Lacking negotiators,we won't have new deals any time soon or we just accept what the others offered.
0	What a total embarrassment! Not in my name and not in Scotland's name! Showing a total lack of respect and behaving in a very infantile manner. This is cringe worthy.
0	Commoner, realist & proud son of Irish Immigrants since 1975. Financial Adviser since 2004. More likely than ever to say he told you so since Dec 2019.
1	We are right to LEAVE, enough is ENOUGH, we've been shafted from pillar to post by Europe, forced to take in unreasonable numbers of people, being told what we can and can't do etc.
1	History won't remember this evening as the moment the UK regained its independence. It will be the moment when the self-righteous establishments dream of an authoritarian EU died.
0	This decision makes me embarrassed to say I am British
1	Hello, Hello UK, you all still alive after Brexit? best wishes from Australia.
1	Brexit: the best and most important political decision of this century! God bless the UK!
0	Many Brexiters are so thick they were unable to understand how it might affect the company they worked for. "We don’t mind being a bit poorer if we get our sovereignty back" - they didn’t translate that as "you might lose your job".
0	The darkest day in Britain since Suez.
0	Let's just hope the UK can recover from shooting itself in the head, and Boris and his bigots don't destroy this country. They've already seriously damaged our democracy, the economy, our reputation and the integrity of the Union.
1	Do it.  Why have a union when you can have an EMPIRE
1	I am European by culture, descent and sentiment.  I speak (rustily) several European languages.  I have served in or with German, French and Norwegan Armed Forces.  I love and know Italy, France, Germany, Austria and Norway. I loathe the unaccountable bureaucracy of the EU. I do not support its continued existence. I am a democrat.
1	Look at all these young people saying it was a terrible idea with the little real world experience that they have. It just shows how synthesized these people were into believing that being in the EU was a good thing. Politicians should be charged by corrupting the youth. The plan all along was to create one super state and keep certain people in power inside EU like as if they were kings. Nobody even votes and they appoint themselves in power. These "old people" that you punks like to bash just saved your asses. Respect your elders as they have more wisdom in their hand than you do in your entire body you little shits . If you love undemocratic rules how about you go live in an Arab country.
1	The EU is no match for the might of the Commonwealth. We shall crush them!
0	Far right fascists = brexit.
0	I've got one they can have for free: #StopBrexit.
0	Stay in EU . Without EU wildlife and environmental laws the Conservatives would destroy everything that I love.
0	We have simply lost all influence in European decisions and made ourselves vulnerable to US bullying, which has started already. We will continue to comply with EU regulations but have no say whatsoever.
1	Democracy 1 EU Fascist state 0
0	brexit is currently ruining the UK and now lobotomites are already hoping for a nexit
1	We should leave. The EU is worthless as is. Governs with back to its citizens, and not because it’s leading them. EU has other interests in mind which are not those of it’s citizens or Europe.
0	He said a lot without saying anything...
1	Can't believe Remainers think the EU is a good thing!? It beggars belief. It threats the peoples & Nations of Europe with contempt
1	The UK will soon become the only wealthy western nation to be outside of  a major continental common market where the big player sets the rules.  Norway, Iceland and Switzerland all accept EU rules to be part of the  big European single market whereas Canada accepts US trade standards to  be part of the big North American single market. At one point the UK  will be forced to choose between standards imposed by Brussels and  standards imposed by Washington or risk losing its wealth and become a  new Argentina.
0	A sad day as Britain finalizes a choice that removes them from an organization they helped create to stand with the rest of Europe for a better world.
1	We'll all be better off for it
1	Thank you God for Britain's freedom
1	The European union has killed itself by expanding without the publics consent.
1	Good. Do not bow down to the EU. Their businesses need us and they also need our financial services. Tell them where to go.
0	Hopefully, with how long it took to get brexit started, the country had enough time to stock food and medicine.
1	Bye bye EU, hello freedom!
1	I have decided we are going to colonise the Galápagos Islands & turn them into a penal colony. Sent there will be, Republicans, Scottish Nationalists, & people who visit Blackpool through the holiday season! Let’s make the British Empire Great again! #Brexit
0	The truth is that this story of the UK and the rest of Europe has a long history and one thing for sure, it's not about to end. I prefer being a useful member of a society and no nationalities.
0	However I strongly believe that it needs reform.
0	The north of England is definitely neglected
1	Remainers conveniently forget that they have spent the last 3 years predicting that we would crash out with a no deal Brexit and that an exit deal (with a transition period) wouldn’t make it through Parliament - facts never bothered them before
1	Definitely out, I want to see Great Britain great again and it won’t happen whilst we remain in the EU.
0	I can certainly tell how potential British customers will treat Bitpanda
1	Thank God we have left, now we can fly our Great National Flag High and be proud.
1	Just take read what these Remainers have to say about Leave voters. Unbelievable arrogance and elitism. It's their remarks that have caused so much devision and hate in this country. I'm looking forward to next year when we will see the economy figures.
0	Yes, let's revoke A50 and forget this stupid idea called Brexit for ever.
1	We have had foreign government for 47 years. So how did that happen given that our Bill of Rights 1689 prohibits foreign people having jurisdiction in the uk?
0	Brexit pretty much is the only international news we've been getting besides Ukrain/Russia and the Australian wildfires.  From what I've heard it seems like it wasn't the best decision, and the process leading to the actual exit was a big clustefuck.
0	Britain begged to join the European Union, I fully support their right to go. But doing it while complaining looks very silly..
0	Putin & Trump want Britain to leave the European Union. No one else in their right minds wants this.
1	You can want a better Britain without being racist. Just because you feel that local builders being undercut by Polish ones coming in and sending money back to Poland rather than spending it on the local economy, doesnt mean you wouldnt welcome Polish doctors, nurses, teachers or whatever the country needs.  As someone who married a non EU national, I found out first hand how governments were trying to look tough on immigration whilst hundreds of thousands of Europeans came in with no comeback. People didnt want it, it was foisted on them, and politicians didnt want to / couldnt say that there was nothing they can do, but there wasnt. Certainly as the price rose, and the hoops increased, it became obvious they were trying to do something, but they couldnt do anything effective.  The problem is the EU and the politicians within it. Hopefully other countries will get their referendum now, but seems unlikely, until the next round of elections, when parties who promise elections will be elected.
0	I don’t think that the grumpy old men and grumpy old women who swung the vote in favour of Leave care tuppence about the employment situation. They are either already retired or living a life of Riley on benefits. The drop in living standards as a direct result of the Brexit disaster is unlikely to percolate down to them for some considerable time, assuming they are still alive at that point.
1	Yes! The country has done what it wanted and has left the 4th reich
0	Brexit is a misguided attempt to turn back the clock to better times
1	Fantastic! Awesome! Congratulations!
0	This is the UK decay
0	now that uk is the enemy we should destroy there economy.
1	Us Americans are so happy for Britain!!! CONGRATULATIONS!!!! FREEDOM IS YOURS!
0	I'm not Anglo, cuz I'm not from Los Angeles, but Why are British ppl fleeing the continent? Is Europe that bad? Where is Britain gonna move to? Arkansas?
1	We will now have true democracy once again.
0	‘We won, you lost, get over it’ they tell me. But nobody can tell me what they ‘won’ in tangible non-soundbite terms. How their families will not be actually worse off with Brexit. Get over it? No. I care for this country. Now we can begin the #Rejoin process!
1	Rubbish. Paying billions for a trade DEFICIT and unlimited low-skilled EU immigration etc etc. is a very bad idea. It's as straightforward and obvious as that. More importantly, the rotten and corrupt EU organisation is completely undemocratic.
0	Boris's Brexit Britain. The UK will be begging for a bailout from the EU within months.
0	"Optimism is suddenly in the air". Yet Brexiteers, in spite of winning, are still angry and don't know why. Cummings came close to assaulting an ITV reporter on the 31st of January for merely asking him how he was celebrating Brexit Day. And Boris couldn't wait one day to start threatening the EU with subjecting all imports from the EU to extensive border checks. Then hardly another day passed before he was bleating on about the EU being so unfair because it was unilaterally trying to look after its interests, unlike, ahem, the UK which never said a thing or threatened anything or anyone! You can almost see them putting their excuses in earlier for when it all goes tits up: oh it is the EU to blame! Never mind that we have the promised all conquering sovereignty that we were told would usher in a glorious era of Britannia ruling the waves again!
1	Freedom from petty, foreign, unelected, pathetic politicians, EU rules, regulations, controls and inward-looking socialist, neo-progressive, liberal Europeans. I'm good with that.
1	I dont even vote Conservative l, but I'm behind you on this. Don't dare quit.
1	why would we want to stay ? The eu has done nothing for Britain .
1	The UK Government need to stop manipulating the vote with stolen data. Watch the Great Hack 👾👾👾 and see how they rigged the referendums and elections.
1	The U.S. market is far larger than the EU market anyway. Shouldn’t the U.K. be more concerned with negotiating a free trade agreement with a real friendly country?
0	Putin is smiling.
1	Well done UK 1st is nationalism & safety.....economic development is just a 2nd thing..... Protect your country & Culture.....
1	Nigel Farage, Hero of the People of GB!
0	Since when did Brexit supporters pay any attention to experts?
0	I remain unconvinced that a significant proportion of Leave voters will be happy with the eventual outcome.
1	EVERYONE WILL BE SAD
1	Boris and his team are correct, we are out of the EU and will not take their diktats any longer!  That’s because………..  Brexit=Freedom
1	Ha Ha what a waste of time , we voted OUT, the end.
0	I mean ... the loss of freedom of movement is catastrophic for my industry. No Googling needed, just a massive reduction in working opportunities and income for us all.
0	Who will conservatives blame once we are out of the European Union
0	Imagine if intelligent and highly advanced extraterrestrials visited the Earth. It would be interesting to watch people trying to explain to the visitors why most humans feel that it is important for us all to live in separate and isolated little countries. Especially if the aliens ask "But... aren't you all just one species, living on the same planet..?" What answer would we give..?
0	t’ll be fun to watch the whole shitshow implode in on itself.
1	The dutch, french, danish, spanish, irish, germans and belgians, have their own fishing waters, surley they can fish each others waters without using ours, or am I missing something !!!
0	It seems that the patients have all broken out the asylum today.
1	The EU only wanted us for our money.
1	Way to go Britain. Finally someone puts their foot down.  -American
0	Well this morning I really wish Thanos would turn up and snap 52% of the population away #brexit
0	21 Tory MPs lost the whip for trying to block a no-deal Brexit.
1	I'd rather be free with a bag of chips, than in chains at a 5 course dinner!! Congrats Britain you are free once more!!!
1	Can't wait till the license fee is scrapped so BBC are thrown in the capitalist shark tank. Wont live long.
0	Only a minority of the population (17 million) voted for brexitIt is entirely right that the other 50 million will hold this minority of mainly Brexiteer pensioners responsible for everything that happens from this point forward
0	Brexit is and will continue to be lies and fantasy nonsense, blaming the EU and remainers and taking no responsibility whatsoever. Johnson is playing to the domestic gallery, relying on the stupidity of many of his supporters and believe you me, many of them haven't a clue. This was predictable.
0	I feel complete utter contempt for Brexiters. That very name will become a curse word one day
1	Simply Superb . Thank you for being so strong Prime Minister .  The United Kingdom needs you  Encourage Southern Ireland to join us by leaving the EU `Block `. link arms and become the political British Isles again . Sorry Brussels .. Check Mate .
1	Thankyou for respecting the vote and doing what the people wanted! Unlike some people who used delay tactics
0	So according to some, people are weaker together. Economic prosperity is attained by having it bound to borders and delays. And war is averted if you do not co-operate with your neighbors by putting up restrictions. It's the inverse of what history should've thought us. But it seems yet again, people will never learn.
1	I have hope this decision changes UK, and changes EU, maybe make other countries exit
1	The eussr will not and cannot survive, it’s crumbling.   All they can do is to bankrupt even further the remaining states.germany is almost financially drained, the French will certainly revolt in the micron attempts to impose further taxes; Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy are already bankrupt and can offer not a euro more. Those which are left are financially incapable of meeting the huge chasm about to appear in the euseer finances.  Bye bye eussr ...
0	With my EU citizenship trashed, for all time ... my rights to live anywhere in 27 brilliant countries gone ... up in smoke.  I am 66 ... And I say f*** to a system that gives Boris a majority of 88 MPs on the vote of 43.5% of those who voted.  De Facto dictatorial power for 5 years. Not a single Tory MP who can represent my Remain point of view ... Boris got every single last candidate to swear to Brexit before being allowed to be a candidate. Idiotic and stupid are far too polite to describe the system we have. Why should anybody bother to vote when the 56.5% have 80 fewer seats than the 43.5%. And what happened to the report on Russian interference ... ? I am not proud to be British ... rather I am ashamed to be associated with this small minded selfish rather stupid bunch of people who tolerate such unfairness.
0	Sad day for this great country and her allies
0	Well of course he is. #Brexiters are so high on their #Brexit cr*p they'd cheer a deranged clown if it insulted #EU... Oh look - they just did. When will they actually get back to looking after their voters (most of whom DO NOT NOW WANT BREXIT)???
0	UK has never been more separated until Brexit.
0	Boris is leading this country into a dark unknow future no deal brexit will lead to mass job loses factory closing down and go to an eu member country to save pay tariff food shortages nhs drug shortages and mass debt on people
1	The media is still very biased ... It's time to support brexit
0	I was waiting for victorious hate messages for me to come in. Would have been nice to be proven wrong, but it wasn’t to be. I’m not interested in sharing them. But let me say: your hate hasn’t silenced me before, it won’t do so now. Enjoy your Brexit & #BrexitDay. You own it now.
1	I do not understand how having sovereignty over your own soil can even be percieved as a negative thing
1	Shopping weekends in England will soon be dirt cheap again. can't wait to visit those poor poor Possums.
1	Sometimes a nation needs to secure it's society. Not up for WW3, gonna take a pass cousins. Best wishes
1	Brits are an example of courage to the rest of the world.
1	Selfish country.
0	Mass immigration is going up and this government has told us so. Not quite the change most were looking for
0	Shame on those who lied an cheated and stoked hatred and conned people into voting for an impossible idea that would make them poorer, cost them jobs, strip them of rights, and humiliate this country, all so that the Brexit elite and their pals could get richer. Shame on them!
0	Bo Jo's withdrawal deal is full of holes. Should have been No Deal, clean Brexit.
0	Today's Financial Times front page "Javid set to miss surplus target as finances head for £12bn black hole". More austerity or tax rises, or both? #r4today I reckon this #Brexit thing was not a wise idea.
1	Can't believe how brainwashed the Remainers and uninformed those young adults are. Stop the bickering, grow a pair and get patriotic. Britain will be far better off outside than in (b.t.w. I'm an educated white collar worker). I'm fully prepared to trade one or two years of uncertainty for a lifetime of self rule and all the prosperity it'll give to Britain from innovation, entrepreneurship and true free trade. Rule Britannia!
0	Nations are past. World Government is future.
0	immigration to live or work
0	EU lost all control over Britain and Italy If Macron loses in 2022 they wont be able to last more than a couple of years.
0	british people are controlled by banks
0	Just a bunch of losers trying to keep their jobs even though it is bad for all Europeans.
1	The EU has only ever been interested in British money, nothing more. We are a cash cow.     That is why they have been wanting the extensions, and still are gearing towards trying to get this transition extended. Its about our contributions, our money. They need our contributions to continue as long as possible.     The difference now is, there won't be another extension. They have 11 months to work with us to get  a deal sorted, or its WTO and Singapore on Thames. Personally, I'm in favor of leaving without a deal. It will deliver the absolute clean break we need.
1	The EU is already looking and sounding last century.
0	Business owner who claimed Brexit would make Britain thrive loses his business, all his money and blames Brexit. Does it get any better?
1	Imagine how people will feel about belonging to the EU when the UK becomes a 3rd world country in the near future...
0	You know that with no deal,we'd lose ALL trade agreements we have with any country
1	Much too much one sided agreement. Are we completely stupid? Who would , in thieve right mind, would agree to that. From now on the EU will keep demanding more and more cash from the UK. Thinking differently from that ,you must be crazy. Sit back and watch it happen. I honestly think we should walk away and that is the only possible way to get proper deals for our country. That is the way the EU works. We do not compare with other EU countries and never have.
0	Anyone know the collective noun for a group of elderly, racist #brexit jihadists?
0	I feel so sad for myself to have to be born at a time like this.Can't wait to have to pay for everything! 🙄
1	The EU was a bad idea from day one!!
1	I think classing those out voters as undereducated is a bit cheeky, I voted out and am by no means undereducated.      Perhaps what they mean is that I was never exposed to the brainwashing propaganda such as the "Erasmus" programme and the pro eu propaganda blatantly practiced in modern UK universities.      Perhaps I have had time to watch the eu grow from a simple trading partnership into a political entity intent on creating a European state.     Perhaps I read a lot of books written from pro,neutral and anti eu standpoints.      Perhaps it is because I visited Brussels and watched and listened to the lobbyists in the bars and coffeshops.      Perhaps it is because my work means rubbing shoulders with many Europeans on their home turf.      Perhaps it is because I listened to them.     So yes,I am undereducated in that I have not studied a non subject like modern European art forms in a university in the last twenty years.      I should count myself lucky,and I do!
0	#RejoinEU #rEUnite
0	Tyrants! And take away American money, defence and protection, it will all fall apart!
0	I stay European and I stand by the EU! A reason for me to say "bye" to a nationalist England!
1	Go Britain! The EU has been holding you back and holding you hostage....
0	I can't wait for the moment that those that voted for Brexit and the tories finally understand that this isn't going to happen and that here is no cake, they can't eat it and what they can eat is chlorinated, GM, mass-produced filth.
1	Bollocks to the EU
1	If only the "Remains" had enough, honest and open education - and true knowledge of the dictatorial EU and unelected bureaucrats, ,many "Remains" would have voted to leave!
0	The banks will be celebrating the prospect of record profits from the UKs business and household debt from no deal. The golden age of bank profit from debts and loans is the only outcome from Johnson and the Tories.
1	FACT: The British people overwhelmingly voted to leave the EU
0	one of the reasons I personally dislike it because it gives more power to our government; we have no constitution, Parliment can pass and repeal whatever they want. Between this, Theresa May's reclusiveness and the Home Secretary's attempts expand surveillance, I'm worried this country is moving into a more authoritarian direction. (the EU have a list of regulations that every country in them has to adhere to)
1	MAGA & MEGA  LIFE IS GOOD!
0	If we exit, prepare to do worse.
0	Bye bye Brits, may the arrogance be with you!
0	Leaving Europe will be a catastrophe for this country, economically and politically, but most important of all culturally. It would be depressing to live in an inward looking anti-diverse country.
0	Thick as shit. Sorry but it's quite obvious these morons have no idea what they voted for
0	In a massive bit of schadenfreude,  I argued heavily to my parents to vote remain.  They told me that they were voting leave and why worry it wouldn’t effect me anyway.  Apart from, it totally did as I immediately started having trouble with EU based suppliers and contractors who were worried about it.  Anyway, because of Brexit, my dad is losing his job, the one he’s had since he was 17 years old. 39 years in the same role and it’s moving to Germany.  I love him so I can’t even enjoy the irony of that
1	Yay!!! Freedom!!
1	Hard brexit please
0	None of this is the EU's fault, IN FACT it will be easier for your government to do that now
1	I voted brexit and will NEVER EVER regret it. Brexit will give us back our right to rule our country the way WE see fit.
0	Who cares anymore. Bring the cuts, cuts, cuts. Maybe the idiots that voted for this shit show will wake up and realise what everyone else already knows? Until then I won't shed a tear for anyone who wonders why their lives are poorer.
0	Its amazing that one of the pillar members of the EU has convinced a plurality of its population that the EU is the reason for it's problems and has now left it in such a way. My admiration of the British people and their government has been greatly diminished by these actions from the last 4 years
1	Boris was brilliant, he was unifying and UK first. Only a biased, prejudice fool is not able to truly listen to the words spoken.
0	Brexit itself is staggeringly likely to cripple the economy and has  created a huge divide already in the country. Adding Scottish  independence into the mix will almost certainly destabilise the economy  even more and, if independence is sought after, politically split the  country in two. In that sense, it would be incredibly destructive for  the current government to risk that.
1	Should be a national holiday
1	Boris and his team are correct, we are out of the EU and will not take their diktats any longer!
1	I doubt 10 years from now many people will admit to being remainers.
1	I despise the way the EU is ran and there is no way for it to be reformed other than 27 countries seemingly agreeing to change it which will never happen as there will always be one or two who will vote against change for their own personal gain.
1	Leave. I don't feel comfortable with the idea that people that were not elected by the people of my country can make laws that govern my country and be unaccountable for any effects as a result of these laws. It seems very undemocratic, if not anti-democratic.
0	The could already.. The EU has the most trade agreements in the world. That's also why the UK could benefit and grow to become the 5th largest economy in the world. And remember: over 50% of the export, goes to the EU. Its a really big market, on the doorstep. Why would you risk to lose it.
0	The whole referendum was a fucking bailout to a Tory party that would rather gamble with the future of the country and stay in power rather than lose gracefully.
1	Veterans and their families are behind you. Never vote Corbyn or Libs
1	What happens? Nothing good. The UK is finished.
1	A large majority of those under 25 want to be in the EU. They will indoctrinate their kids and in a generation BINGO! We shall be back in the EU, with the euro. Job done.
1	If only #UK had true, effective opposition and honest main stream media to bring this to #British people attention
1	This is a big day for people who feel like they personally fought in WW2 despite being born in 1958.
0	It’s quite funny how the Brexiters are STILL , trying to CONVINCE THEMSELVES - they did the - ‘right thing ‘ !
1	The concept of the EU is great. The current implementation is absolutely awful. Leaving is stupid.Staying without serious reform is also equally stupid
0	Welsh farmers are now bleating about losing EU farming subsidies and there will be tariffs on their lamb etc.Yet these very same farmers voted to leave the EU.They will soon regret that choice. Much more worrying is the loss of most of our car manufacturing-Airbus,chunks of finance,big sections of Pharmaceutical
0	Every time someone says they're going to pull out, usually a baby is born. They'll be back. Lol
1	Enough of this. We are out - good luck to them.
0	The most disappointing independence day in history
0	england is broke now
1	What will change, everything, we are an independent sovereign nation again
1	Happy First Day In 47 Years As An Independent Sovereign Nation State, folks!
0	To any friends from the EU reading this - I can assure you that a huge percentage of the UK population are sorry to leave the EU and don’t believe it is the best move for us. We are also embarrassed about those MEP muppets waving flags and behaving like children. Some of us hope to leave this God forsaken country as soon as possible and are working on that too ❤️
0	Why everyone is hailing this like some kind of good thing is beyond me because it’s nothing to be proud of at all. Just shows English people are fucking dumb cunts. I’m actually ashamed to be from England.
1	European countries now have a solid sanity test. Leave and prove you are sane or stay and prove you deserve your slavehood.
1	E.U KILLS SMALL BUSSINESS THAT FACT
1	I am not a radical simply because I support my nation- I am not a bigot because I believe in British jobs for British workers- I am not a racist just because I think British people should be put first- I am not intolerant just because I want our borders closed to protect our culture and identity- I should not be classified as extream because I want extremists deported- & most important of all I should not have to explain myself in my own country.
1	It's official! BREXIT Jan 30, 2020!!! A historical day
1	Brexit establishes the sovereignty of Britain.
0	They will realize that they stand without and trade deal with the EU, and after slamming the door leaving EU, the chance for any EU country will forget and make a new deal is small.
0	Disgusting.. what failed us was the negotiators not the EU Shame on all the Brexit Bigots!!
0	What a Joke country which colonised all over the world. Had to fight for their Independence. so funny,.
1	Down with the corrupt EU 👎
1	The UK will finally be able to determine its own destiny instead of the Brussels "crew" imposing their immigration agenda on it.
0	What a bloody stupid idea Brexit is!
0	Fine sweet words by Boris Johnson. Pity he doesn't mean a single syllable. Bit of a Tory tradition this, but as the old saying goes, 'fine words butter no parsnips'
1	Goodbye EU....and we don't mind closing the door behind us..
0	We did not make any promises other than brexit will be a disaster in about 3-10 years that any GCSE student of modern global business studies will likely tell you why..
1	When Brexit won, I smiled the whole day
1	For the UK, it was the right strategic call
1	Freedom again!!!!
0	As u/Mintamor has posted, Brexit has economic merits.  The weird political situation the EU has (economically one country, politically 27 countries) causes some weird effects that nobody has really encountered in a large scale before and therefore knows how to solve.  With that said, the current form of Brexit is entirely stupid.  None of the valid issues that some people have raised about membership in the EU have been addressed by the Tory governments, and there is no coherent plan.  The UK has decided to leave, but has no clue where it wants to go.  The leave campaign decided that in order to win, they can't have any specific plans.  While this is true, it also dooms Brexit to being a cluster fuck and all the economic problems of EU membership are more likely to get worse rather than better.
1	I don't care what it costs to get us 100% out of the clutches of the failing banking cartel that has halved its member states share of global GDP in 30 years with its ponzi scheme currency and protectionism and wrecked the lives of millions of unemployed Italians and Greeks and Spaniards thanks to the incompetence and lies of the European Commission and Council and the ECB, not to mention the EU removal of democratic leaders to suit its agenda. So when all the noise is over we will do a complete stock take on what has been achieved for our independence and sovereignty and if we've been lied to the fight will start again
1	The EU will no longer be able to cause problems in the UK anymore
0	Although in theory, solving brexit’s challenges could help alleviate genuine problems the UK has, it probably won’t.
1	Please remove the flags says it all really. The EU feels threatened by the identity of nation states, because its underlying objective is to disempower and ultimately dismantle them. NO THANK YOU AND BYE BYE
1	After brexit Ireland may become one nation
0	You must surely have noticed during the election they were careful to never say Brexit would be a success (as it would come back to haunt them) - they say it has to be done whatever happens because 'sovereignty')
1	For a start BBC, you can drop the EU bias, secondly, reintroduce free licenses for the over 75s, get rid of Lineker, and all the rest of the presenters with over inflated ego's, and return to pre 1973 broadcasting. When our beloved Auntie was always warm and comforting to have around. If you are not careful, you will be binned by many disgruntled listeners and viewers!!
0	This means nothing. The EU have no reason to give us an extension. We should have left at the original date
1	we are happy to be out
1	I'm voting Leave to escape the United States of Europe, recession be damned. If the economy was such a sacred cow we'd never go into war or subsidise unsustainable industry
0	Britain has a great many talented people. However, it no longer has superiority in any particular technological field. Financial services and legal services are the exception. If we crash out without a deal, therefore, we will see a decline in our manufacturing output and it is difficult to see where the growth areas of new trade can come from aside from financial services. All this will further entrench the divide between London and the South East and the rest of Britain. The Government can try to offset this with public spending, but the Conservatives have never really been committed to this at the level it would be needed. Altogether rather a depressing picture.
1	I’m sure there WILL be teething troubles. But it’s a small price to pay for freedom!
0	Brexit has enabled and normalised racism and xenophobia and the worms have crawled out from under their rock .
1	We need to leave but they wont let us !
1	A most historic and beautiful day in British history. Freedom, friendship and prosperity. Good luck to all the nations of the eu. There is no more remainers and leavers only Britons.
1	Brexit = The End of the UK
1	No more refugees!
0	If you have free trade with the EU, you must abide by its regulations and rules. Otherwise you don't get free trade with the EU.  Why is this so hard for Boris to understand?
0	beginning of the end of UK
0	I am afraid that a lot of Brexiters KNEW they were lied to but they did not care because most were blinded by xenophobia. They are what is known as SINGLE ISSUE voted where any damage is acceptable as long as their xenophobia is addressed.
1	Words can't express how much I loathe the EU. They are just Globalists trying to achieve centralised power over the European people and also to replace us with the 3rd world.
1	I've now I unfollowed @BBCNews  and @SkyNews  and cancelled my licence fee. Disgraceful from a national, state funded broadcaster. The sooner Boris stops the licence tax the better.
0	Brexit latest DOWNSIDES Job losses Businesses gone End of manufacturing Workers/environmental rights gone
1	Happy Thanksgiving and Happy Brexit everybody! Enjoy the greatest economy in American history folks, all thanks to @realDonaldTrump
0	Still nothing solved.
0	But now you taken the damages AND still have to pay for the NHS. Taking the best of both sides!
0	A country needs economic stability, in order to focus on more money for NHS, education, and other urgent matters in the UK. A brexit in it's current form will destroy all of that.
1	The Eurozone is one of the slowest growth blocs in the world. Sinking under a failing single currency, mass immigration, spiralling sovereign debt and a backward bureaucracy. The UK can be amazing free from the EU’s shackles
0	leaving EU would mean leaving the Single Market and Customs Union UK
0	Don't blame the EU if you haven't succeeded.
1	EU membership involved giving up some control over domestic affairs.
0	Huge unemployment down the road, alot of companies leaving auld blighty. Alot of money leaving the economy. Business with America will not go well either.
0	Brexit is a joke
1	Uncertainty...totally the opposite...the UK knows where we are going....heavy hearts...we are totally elated....we are the UK...
1	So happy for our British brothers and sisters!! Liberty Rocks!
0	It’s ok. Britain just don’t ask for German tax payers money when you have problems. Thanks
0	Brexit will cause more damage than good and will see the end of United Kingdom. And along in process also will cause more hardship for it's people.
0	Business owner who claimed Brexit would make Britain thrive loses his business
0	Will we still be in Eurovision though? .... Think anyone would vote for us?
0	You'll never have a quiet world till you knock the patriotism out of the human race.
0	The British Parliament is behaving like US Congress. US Congress more or less always opposes the President. But its by design, so the government usually functions the same. I think its unprecedented that a British Prime Minister is opposed by the Parliament for so long, yet wasn't removed. So its a shock to the British political culture.
0	I'm voting remain. I've lived in Mainland Europe and my parents and  grandparents both worked there for a time and I believe staying in will  be stronger for the country than going alone.   However I feel I can't state this opinion to the general population  because I'll be told I'm foolish and too young to understand the real  issues of the world. I've been fed up with the campaigning from both  sides for months and months I want us all to chill the fuck out and move  on. Except we won't. Whatever we decide this week will cause a shit  storm in Westminster and we'll have a general election by Christmas when  all the shit will start to again.   I vote because it's my right, I vote because it's important and I vote because I care.
0	Absolute bullsh*t. #Brexit IS populism. UKIP and fascists are stirring BECAUSE of Brexit. You don't get to lie about that. #Remain is now the will of the people. There will be a #PeoplesVote - and the UK will #stay in the #EU.
0	I stay European and I stand by the EU! A reason for me to say "bye" to a nationalist England!
1	Ah, this is great that we have independence from the EU, now time to have ourselves an independent Scotland! FREEEEDOOOOM
0	The problem is that all these people who voted for brexit, not thinking about all the consequences, are now being shocked that the consequences go beyond immigration and funding for the NHS. Not saying that everyone who was pro-brexit didn't anticipate all the consequences, but most of them didn't....
0	I'm pissed off because Scotland my country voted to stay but of course Westminster just ignored our votes completely
0	It's only the start and the possibility of a happy outcome is very unlikely.
0	Since we've been in the EU we've had to concentrate our war efforts on more distant targets. This is a bit of a bugger logistically. As has been said below, as soon as we distance ourselves from Europe we always end up at war with some of them. This will create loads of local armaments jobs and, given their proximity ability to fight back, should lead to a major boost to our construction industry. The rapid population reduction will also take the pressure off our public services. Think back to pictures of London/ Berlin in 1947. Yes we'll be poor, starving, diseased, bereaved, depressed but at least we'll be free from regulation. The main reason for staying inside the EU is that it stops our egotistical, sabre rattling politicians (and Royals) from killing 'the evil foreigners' or asking our children to die fighting to keep them in power. I accept that this approach doesn't sell as many tabloids but I think its a price worth paying.
0	I know it is hard for Brexiters to understand that many on the continent value other things than just cash. Like belonging to a union of equals. Like having rights over a whole continent. Like cooperating.
1	Congratulations Britain! Let freedom ring!
1	The EU are selling our fish to China. We need to cut out the EU middleman and ensure CI and UK fishermen are able to get their fish in to Chinese hands. Welsh welks are on sale in S. Korea. It has been discussed in a Fisheries debate in HoC. Check it out via Hansard. Gove talks of a "£1bn bonanza" post brexit.
1	As an American, it's good to see our British brethren do what's best for their country and break free from the chains of the EU and globalism.
0	It will mean new trade friction for agriculture and manufacturing; and significant new barriers for service exports
1	The EU itself is losing global share. It policies have failed. The UK should be globally outlooking not an EU crumb hoover where we have no say. Anyone can see this political club is ridiculous.
1	I think that EU should not be all about Economy. The main problem with actual EU is that is an economic Giant and a political Dorf. It is very significative that precisely Great Britain, one of the first promotors of the idea of an Unified Europe, becames the first to leave the group.  On the other side, I think Great Britain will continue to assume a preponderant role in World Econmy. Sorry, I havent been objective in the answer, but I think the main problem with EU is that economic issues always came first relatively to other signicant ones. I coul not help it!
0	If England wanted a say to what happens in Europe they lost it now. Like Oliver's point here, if they hate the EU they'd be better off having a seat at the EU decision maker's table and not leaving all of Europe to be decided by the French and the Germans. They'd be fools to think what happens in Europe won't effect them in Britian.
0	Do I support Brexit in is current shambolic form? Absolutely not.
1	You will regret this.
1	They have all been our historic enemies at some point in time, and it looks like most of them still are.
1	That has always been the problem,We stick by the rules Whie Germany fance and others laugh at us and do as they please. You are only scared of compertition if you are uncompetative.
0	Worst thing my generation will see and live through. It's not good for us as a nation or for Europe.
1	Good on Britain, on to bigger and much better things.
1	The EU is nothing but a waste of taxpayers money. those bureaucrats have abused their position only to enrich themselves and their sponsors instead of looking out for european interests. im glad britain voted out and i hope the rest of will too
1	Getting Brexit done, in the sense of leaving the European Union was, in a way, the easy bit
1	Remember the EU needs Britain more than Britain needs the EU remember this
0	A politician who has been sacked twice for lying, who is known to lie to everyone, from his wives, girlfriends, family and to his own political party now has unassailable power.
0	Interesting comments about being pushed around by the EU. Wait until we have a trade agreement with the US, then we'll see the true meaning of being pushed around!
0	Britain is basically Pompeii if Pompeii had voted for the volcano.
0	Brexit is a self-inflicted wound; the people of this country hold the knife, and they don't have to use it if they don't want to. The people, not the hardline Brexiteers, are in charge.
1	If we Vote Leave we will be able to stop handing over so much money to the EU and we would be able to spend our money on priorities here in the UK
1	I can finally travel Europe without worrying about my arrest warrant in the UK

1	The blood supply to the cancer that is eating British society has been cut, now you need to work on the tumor.

0	United we stand, divided we fall. This now applies to the world. The end is near? The world had better unite or it is all over folks.
0	In a year from now when the pound may be worth less than 1 euro, and all things that are imported, fruit, food, oil, clothes,electronics etc etc will be more expensive....The people that voted for brexit may regret what they have done to england...It's still time to reverse the brexit but the time is running out. Why not vote a second time to be really sure?
1	t must be painful for the BBC to admit.
0	I'm against the Brexit, for the same reasons I would have been against Scotland leaving the Union. The people who are "for" have not proposed a realistic (or any real) vision of what it would look like
1	I'm voting Leave to restore Britain's national sovereignty and parliamentary democracy. Any other arguments - whether for or against - are immaterial.
1	This is because the nationalists have portrayed the EU as an oppressive force - thereby fooling people into believing that #Brexit equates to "FREEDOM". When the truth is, by stripping us all of our rights & freedoms under EU law, we are being oppressed by the populists
0	A conservative kipper always knows who's to blame: Before Brexit: It's all Europe's fault After Brexit: It's all Europe's fault
0	Use your brain - vote Remain .
0	brexit is the worst possible thing for our country
0	The UK government have seriously underestimated just how difficult and protracted the trade negotiations are going to be. They really haven't got a clue and one can only assume they are either profoundly stupid people or preparing to fail and go for No Deal. Either way, Brexit is going to be a monumental failure.
1	Good move. EU is too authoritarian.
1	Time for Britain to both Roar and for Britain to Bite Back There is a global stage and we can rule our waves again. Happy Independence
1	UK will be ok, maybe economy will be slow and decline a little bit, but UK will survive it not the end of UK

1	I have nothing against foreigners, But look what happened years ago when Enoch Powell said no to foreigners coming into the country, all parties kicked him out, Now look what has happened, the uk won't be the uk any more if we stay in and will end up having a foreign flag flying over us instead of our union jack.
0	I'm looking forward to the day we go crawling back to the eu
0	English nationalism versus British Nationalism is the new ideological battlefield. If Brexit is about anything it about the demise of the British Union and not the European Union.
1	What a great day for Democracy, Freedom and our right to self determination as a nation.
1	I did see a remoaner tweet that accused a member of the crowds decision 2 "black up" showed the level of intelligence of leavers.However, the comment showed how shortsighted "some" remoaners are. It was actually a black gentleman wearing a union flag suit with sunglasses 2 match
1	EU is a shothole that steals countries money
1	Great write up and every bit true. I am on holiday in Grand Canaria at the moment staying in a hotel with Germans french fin's Italians and Spanish all very friendly and they are asking about Brexit all who I have spoken to are very envious and think we will do extremely well.
1	Regrets???? I have so far met two people who said they regretted their vote to REMAIN!
0	Ah, Brexit! The idiots gift that just keeps on giving!
0	On the basis of all the evidence, I’d say Brexit isn’t working.
1	Can’t wait for a new trade deal and closer defense ties with the UK
1	Happy Independence Day Britain!
0	I think that brexiteers are wrong in what's going to happen.
1	It's funny how the EU is actually run and basically owned by the Germans. They want to keep all in to keep them owned so to say. Koodos to the UK for breaking free from an oppressed cash and unable to sell at the price they want for what they sell to other countries. No more German rule
0	REMIND BRITAIN THAT THEY’RE JUST A SMALL ISLE AGAIN
1	Time to make Britain Great Again!!
0	The people comparing this to any war of independence are dense as lead. This act of xenophobia and global opportunism is typical from the UK after they fail at something, or become economically insecure by their own horrible policies. They do it all the time, since forever. This tone deaf move, however, may prove to be their downfall, socioeconomically. Nationalism is just fear, insecurity, and bigotry disguised as a mission, or an honor; its not the opposing force to globalization, rather globalism, which really isn't a thing. Economies create dynamics, people don't go where they aren't herded by demand. We shall see if the british can, yet again, cause the problem, not take responsibility for the problem, be upset there are consequences for their problem-causing, abandon the problem all together, tell others the problem came from foreigners, or Brown and Black People, monetize and politicize the lies, cut and run, write a few text books where they were basically heroes, and absolute gentlemen.
1	It's very simple for me, at this point I pretty much tune out the arguments  put forth on the economy and immigration, it's more about the ceding of  powers do a foreign controller. You can say what you will about the extent to which it does control our laws but the issue is that it does at all.  We joined for an economic union, then the referendum happened and we were promised no political union, then in the 90's they said fuck that and went head long into the creation of the European superstate.   What irritates me more is when I see people arguing something a long  the lines of "The European Union does awesome stuff too and this and  that.", I do not care. I'm English and more than that British, not  European, there may be lessons to be learned sure but I am not a  European citizen, I am a British Citizen, I don't care how big your pot  of gold I'm not shitting on the Magna Carta a year after it's eight  hundredth anniversary.  I also hear people blathering on about how the EU has maintained  peace in Europe; absolute bollocks - Nato has maintained peace in  Europe, the EU nowadays seems to be desperate to taunt Russia and prove  that it's a "big boy" now. I see an underhanded and unbelievably  incremental and slow but very evidently there, degradation of the powers  of the UK.  Also the lies at every turn, Nigel Farage (the crazy horrible badman  that is a fearmongerererer and a nasty xenophobe) pointed out a few  years ago about the future creation of a European Army that had been  discussed and just how terrible an idea it was. No, absolutely not, we  would NEVER build a European army. Fast forward a few years and now  there is one being openly discussed like it's the best idea since sliced  bread. Oh no! Tis but the border force! Equipped with all the latest  tanks and fighter aircraft and naval fleets to deal with those pesky...  Erm... Border jumpers?  There is also the rumour of the removal of Article 50 so there would never be another chance to peacefully leave and this worried me greatly.   The way I see it is this, Voting to Remain has appealed to people I  think in part because of an attitude of "I'm not going to be scared into  leaving!" which is funny because it's pretty much the same mentality on  the other side for, all of big business and the media coming out to say  we should remain makes you feel a little like you're being fear  mongered to.  It seems that to vote to remain is the future (next 40 years)  dissolution of the UK as a sovereign nation, and the vote to leave  (harrowing a journey it may be) will lead to us at the very least being  able to fuck up on our own or prosper on our own. As we should do.   Just a quick note for the word twister's out there, I'm not meaning  some pseudo-hermit kingdom. Normal trade with the world like the world  does anyway, without an (increasingly infectious) political union.
1	Congrats to UK for standing up for their sovereignty!!
0	The triumph of small minds liars and racists. So much to celebrate!
0	A second vote has to be made
1	United Kingdom of Independence
0	Well, a recent study, presented to an economic conference in Manchester, demonstrated that every country joining the EU since 1972 was substantially better off by 2008 than they would otherwise have been, with the sole exception of Greece.
1	I have always recognised the benefits of being part of the EU, however I do not believe in centralisation of power. Being from just outside Belfast I cannot see how a foreign government can effectively legislate for many diverse regions
0	Remainers - "If we'd stayed in the EU we could help improve it and fix it's problems from within, now we can do nothing"  Also Remainers - "You wont win a trade negotiation with the EU they are too strong and too strict, they wont move lines for little England"
0	We're knackered either way, bend over for Europe or get shafted by our own government
0	The UK’s standards must be lowered if it’s to have any chance of competing. Brexit is one big standard-lowering exercise. Britain, the nation of no standards. It’s what the Brexiteers wanted.
0	If we just stayed none of this bs would have happened
0	Poverty....welcome in uk
0	Brexit. A success? In Johnson’s hands? Seriously?
0	Carswell should remain very quiet. If the economy has not taken a hit in the next 12-24 months, he may have a point. We are all now waiting to see what sort of trade agreement emerges. If we end up heading towards WTO - which will be apparent by the Summer - the £ will take a huge hit again and God help manufacturing and agriculture. The reality of what Brexiteers have done has yet to reveal itself. So let's see what happens. You own Brexit, Carswell. It's your responsibility if things turn bad.
0	Dodgy financial decisions and voting for brexit are not related?
0	Sorry that the shitty bigots took over your country
1	Wait until the US signs a trade deal with Britain. It'll make the EU look like a two bit flea market. And best part is we won't tell you how to run your country.
1	In 5 years there will be no EU
1	I am english, you are European.. We are not the same
0	brexit is like going to a club thinking picking a fight with the doorman and tearing up your membership card will obtain entry and more membership advantages.
0	It is sad. A German friend of mine went & posted some pics on facebook. She is a media professional and has lived in the UK for at least 25 years. She was very upset about brexit and considers Britain her home.
0	My condolences to the brits. Boomers truely dug their own grave.
0	A sad day for democracy. Most in the UK oppose #Brexit, most voted for parties against Brexit in the recent election, and the narrow Brexit "approval" in the referendum years ago was exposed as a sham, with the Leave campaign relying on lies and innuendo.
1	No more EU holding us back... RULE BRITANNIA!

1	One word describes the EU now: decline.  Declining share of world trade, declining size and GDP, declining world influence, declining repute and standing, declining integrity.....entropy dear Rem-chums, entropy.
0	Today I see many of the things I believe in (solidarity, cooperation, internationalism) abandoned to follow the empty rhetoric of the past (national interest, sovereignty). My optimism tells me that we must fight and we can revert #Brexit in the future but today is a day of grief
1	Do these muppets not realise what they are doing? These useful idiots are going against our democratic voice. How many referendums will they want until they get what they want? Communism is alive and well in the UK.
0	So Britain died today because of the English. Who are now officially the most hated people on earth. I'm going to spend the next few years sitting by my pool in my luxury villa in Spain laughing while England burns.  You've made your bed of nails now you can lay in it - you absolute mugs.  I'm looking forward to becoming Scottish and I'm now supporting Iceland in the Euros. The English are the scum of the earth.
1	Finally, all countries should leave the EU
0	the momentum for staging a fresh independence referendum
1	The UK will now show the rest of Europe that it is much better to be a willing participant in a close partnership than to be shackled in an arranged marriage. Democracy and accountability will always prevail over dictatorship.
0	We will have to take whatever deal the EU is prepared to give us.
1	EU is a coercive controller - it should be wound-up.
0	It's like chopping off your arm after googling symptoms for the rash on it
0	Maybe the UK should not have left the EU? We would have been spared all the crap since the referendum.
0	Funny to see the same country that everyone else fought to be freed from now celebrating their independence!
1	They will want to join back in 3 years...
1	I just got trolled by a German who told me, "Prepare to eat tinned food only."  I had to set him straight that I'm Scottish and there's more sheep and cows than people here.  Massive fail!  Rather like the EU generally.
0	I think it's stupid. It's a huge mistake. Both the UK and the EU are better off with each other than without
0	Trump and Brexit; two of the worst ideas to have ever befallen English speaking voters. Both arriving out of the blue at the same moment in history like a sorcerer‘s curse. Witch hunt indeed!
1	I didnt think this would happen. The people have Europe have surrendered so much power to government and elite globalist that I didnt think their votes mattered anymore. I am glad I was wrong.
0	A November report by the CBI showed that EU membership was worth up to £3,000 to each household.
0	I prefer not , but in any case it is not important for economics. British will always intend to unite economics with USA , rather than with EU. It is enough if they stay in NATO together with EU and USA.
1	haha keep flooding europe with immigrants and more will leave.
1	This is the greatest moment in the modern history of our great nation.

0	Let's hope the EU say no then they will know the brunt thearesa may has had!!
1	How is leaving the EU a Bad thing?
0	Brexit will be a disaster. Because we are creating barriers with our largest and nearest trading partners. Country is split 50/50. Expect politics to be polarised, as the video shows.
0	You think you have won. And take your day to gloat. But you have lost so much more than you know. We all have. And deep down, I think you know it too. Which is why for supposed "winners", so many of you are still so bitter and so angry. Rest assured, you have saddled your children and grandchildren with decades of rotten fallout to come; it is they who will shoulder the true burden of your reckless self-interest. Not you. What a petty, pointless, mean-spirited and spiteful legacy you leave behind. And what a thing to celebrate. RIP, UK - we fought for you. We really did. But billionare tax avoiders have won. For now.
0	Be rational and vote IN
0	Britain always had one foot out. Now have both. Not a big drama. Dreams of a new empire? Na, maybe an odd 51st state of the Union.
0	We are going to end up with no deal, they'll (Johnson's gang) just call it something else and blame everyone but themselves
1	Thank Goodness.’about time!
1	Who cares. We've left this lot of losers now. They are all insignificant to the UK.
0	As someone who left the country a number of years ago, would I become an illegal immigrant overnight?
1	Well done SIR NIGEL FARAGE. So happy to see the traitors and snowflakes sob and cry their eyes out. I hope they weep for 3.5 years + interest.
1	Nigel America is with you...tell all the big-government elitist bureaucrats to stick it
0	You know this is nonsense.  Clearly you think your #brexit supporters are #thick
1	UK motor exports to countries outside the EU have grown faster than those to the EU.
0	Oh dear - in less than 11 months, you will be definitely losing access to 168 trade agreements and over 40 free trade deals, regardless of what happens with the EU - UK trade agreement. Even if you get it, you can wave goodbye to the above. There are over 6000 different agreements that exist between the EU and other countries governing flights, auto/insurance and driving license acceptances, medicine and so on. Good luck trying to replicate this before the country crumbles. Enjoy the moment Brexiters, it won’t last long - and don’t forget: you will be reminded every step of the way that it is YOUR responsibility.
0	brexit is like going to a club thinking picking a fight with the doorman and tearing up your membership card will obtain entry and more membership advantages.
0	We need the EU otherwise we are a tiny little island on our own. Just start a new EU and ditch all the nuisance countries (France). The others will follow.
1	The air smells that much fresher this morning
1	At least the  people will have some  voice and not be ruled by  appointed Belgian  overlords...
1	Congratulations to our cousins in the United Kingdom on this memorable day.  You have beaten the traitors and regained your independence and sovereignty.  Well done.
1	London's financial district sees few signs of Brexodus https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-bri
0	The divergence from EU rules and standards is really a strange hill for the brexiters to stick their flag in and prepare to die on
1	Finally it happened after millions of years
0	Brexit is actually a step back in the sense that you are going back from being connected to being on your own.
1	Well you did it! Big Boris you absolute legend.
0	I really can’t see how the UK is going to survive this intact. The divisions are growing all the time. All BJ’s talk of healing is just posturing, playing to the crowd. How long can he realistically deny the Scottish government a referendum after what’s happened with Brexit. He’s more unpopular there than Thatcher was. I don’t think the Irish trust him one bit. The way he’s ‘moving us forward’ is never going to work long term.
0	Are you asking brextards if they voted for brexshite
1	There are many potential positives, not to mention the fact that Brexit has really got government and business thinking about how the UK can boost exports and become more competitive.
1	Nigel Farage never quit. Never never quit. Sounds similar to another British Hero. Well done. I wish better times for the good people of the UK. You deserve better times. God Bless the Queen.
0	Nigel can shove his flag into a whole that doesn't have much sunshine! ;-) he is embarrassing out country and people. He doesn't represent me in this disrespectful manner.
0	Good. The British don’t need a bunch of other countries telling them how to run their nation.
0	The fact that you're treating our European friends as adversaries shows just how badly we've gone wrong. We do indeed "have a different economic profile" from our neighbours, as you will soon find out when teh reality of Brexit starts to become obvious to even the thickest Brexiter.
1	Leave  I don't like the direction that the EU is headed. To solve the issues  they've having in the Eurozone they're going to need to push harder for  the "United States of Europe" concept, which isn't what most of the  people in the UK want. Yes, we have an opt-out of 'ever closer union',  but that just leaves us on the fringe of a political union that'll be  looking out for its own interests before ours.  I believe this is the last chance we'll have to get out. We'll always  have the ability to call another referendum, but if we remain within  the EU on Thursday you can be sure that the EU will make sure we're  never in a position to consider leaving again. They're already spending  billions of euros sending propaganda to school kids to tell them how  great the EU is.  I believe that power should be closer to people, not sent to a  different country. There's nothing to stop countries working together to  achieve great things in this world - but that doesn't require the  removal or dilution of nation states. The USA wouldn't allow Argentina,  Mexico and Brazil to write over 50% of its laws and accept free movement  from those countries.  Immigration doesn't affect me much, but it does have  an affect on many towns in the UK. It pushes down wages at the lower  end of the pay-scale and it puts pressure on public services. I'm all  for immigration, but the speed that it's changed is not good - it's  pushing people to the right or far right. In some towns Brits have  become a minority within the space of a decade or two, so it's  understandable that it's made some people feel uneasy.  I think an economy that relies on mass immigration is unsustainable in the long term.  The money that the EU 'spends' on us is a silly argument, because that's tax payers money to begin with.  Europe is failing. Politics within Europe is changing fast, the  eurozone is unstable, unemployment is high and the migration crisis was  handled poorly. I don't think we'll be the only country calling a  referendum in the next few years.  Finally, I don't just don't think the EU is reformable. David Cameron  tried to get reforms, and EVEN THOUGH he had such a strong card to play  (a potential exit), he came away with basically nothing. If he can't  get any reforms when he's got the threat of the UK leaving, he'll never  get any reforms.  I think an exit from the EU will cause some economic disruption. Some  businesses will suffer, others will flourish. I think it's worth it,  though.  The whole "I don't want to be on the same side as Farage,  Boris..etc.." thing is just nonsense. I don't care who is on either side  and there's some fantastic voices on both.
0	Brexit has saved Britain from EU immigrant hell. Greece sends more riot police to Lesbos after immigrant riots.
1	Leave. I don't feel comfortable with the idea that people that were not  elected by the people of my country can make laws that govern my country  and be unaccountable for any effects as a result of these laws. It  seems very undemocratic, if not anti-democratic.
1	Don't give up!
1	Unbelievable welcomed sound.thank you Nigel,Boris & democracy.
1	Brexit excellent excellent excellent excellent kill remainer rats
1	Only lies I remember have come from the EU and the biases bbc and remainers trying too scaremonger us to change our minds telling us we didn't know what we voted for well guess what we did and we still stand by our vote freedom is what we wanted and freedom is what we expect WTO no EU alignment no EU rules
1	Yes! you can go it alone. You are one of the greatest countries on the planet.
0	tragedy for the eu
1	Whats the point of freedom of movement with out freedom of speech ?, freedom of expression ? and most importantly freedom to choose democracy .... The EU is run by old men trying to impose their will of politics on the modern people of Europe .... first and foremost old men and women democracy is the most important thing... You promise a Liberal EU but in effect you are at heart tyrannical...
1	It's heart warming to see you guys celebrating and showing pride in your country again.
1	That's why the smart thing to do is to leave and figure these things out later.
1	FINALLY WOOOOO HOOOOO!!!!!! No to the globalist elites!
0	Life is worse with brexit now if www3 atually happens and if someone attacks us whos gonna back us
1	Great tweet DC. Remember all the furore around the millenuim bug!!! The planes still flew our computers didn’t stop and the country moved on. Let’s make this work it may be tough and we may have difficult times but let’s give it our very best shot!
0	It is not the EU that is destined to collapse, but the UK, as Ireland, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland secede from the UK to apply independently to the EU. No more UK. No more Great Britain. No more Britain, Just little England drifting away, free at last, just like some of the homeless zombies most of us have encountered in our downtowns  who see themselves as so much freer than the rest of us, slaves to jobs, cars, families, bills and mortgages. Meanwhile, the EU goes from 28 to 27, then to 31. There were precedents for the whole affair. On page 74 of "The Government and Politics of the European Union", 7th Edition, 2010, a part of The European Union Series, discussing the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty of 2004, author Neill Nugent states that UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, "anticipating the next general election, responded to a Conservative Party promise that it would call a referendum on the Constitutional Treaty by promising one himself." Cameron was just a copy-cat. Who failed EU History 101. In the next paragraph, Nugent wrote, over six years ago: "A referendum is, of course, much more difficult for a government to control than a parliamentary vote. Citizens can 'cause problems' in two ways: by taking a contrary view to the government on the issue at stake, or by expressing a view on an issue or issues other than the one that features in the referendum question.. Both of these 'problems' influenced voting when ratification referendums were held in France on 29 May 2005 and three days later in the Netherlands on 1 June....  The outcomes of the two referendums were clear rejections of the CT.... The question then became 'what now?'" Doomed to repeat it!  Cameron will have special prominence in the 8th Edition. And a few other places. The wave that ruled Britannia.
1	Should become a bank holiday and call it remembrance Brexit
0	There is no good reason why Britain can't run a viable independent trade policy but for one. Britain will be hopelessly outclassed because policy is directed by Tory fantasists who prefer their tribal fiction to the cold reality of our predicament.
0	At the end of the year we have become Third World citizens
0	History tells us that new eras generally follow disasters . The disaster hasn't happened yet
1	The territory of fascism creeps ever nearer. 'Brexit is completed.
0	Our struggle to rejoin, will commence, the moment the UK leaves.
0	This is the perfect example of the tyranny of the (small) majority. You cannot drag 48% of a nation out of a union they wish to be a part of whilst at the same time promising to heal division. A dark day indeed.
0	If the vote goes the Brexiteer’s way I firmly expect to be arrested on the march tomorrow. Never been charged with any criminal offence but i’m at breaking point and very little to lose - i think i’d be quite proud to be able to frame the charge sheet and show my future grandkids that i actually stood up for something.
0	The UK will become less influential!!
1	BREXIT means Breakfast, gald its done and dusted, onto a better Britain
1	THIS IS OUR COUNTRY WE HAVE A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK ITS NOW OR NEVER IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH PARTY YOU SUPPORT THIS IS ABOUT OUR COUNTRY YOU ONLY HAVE TO VOTE CONSERVATIVES TO GET BREXIT DONE OR SPEND YEARS TRAPPED IN EUROPEAN UNION WE CAN TRADE GLOBALLY

0	I don’t want to leave & Im English
1	The UK is afloat in a sea of leftist tears! Awesome! Makes me happy to see a nation set itself free!
0	I don’t know why, but it all sort of feels like we’re on the Titanic. The Captain is blundering on, full steam ahead. The band is playing. But kinda feels like there might be something ahead.
1	This should have been done three years ago ,now we would be well down road an away from the EU dictatorship by now
0	Boris wants Britain to be "Singapore on the Thames". A one party, authoritarian state. Instead, one generation from now, England will be America's European Puerto Rico, eating genetically modified foods, chlorinated chicken and hormone-laden beef. Then, when they get sick and fat from all their American food products, they’ll have the “freedom” to pay outrageous medical costs in the by then privatized NHS. Freedom in the neo-liberal lexicon means freedom of the strong to predate on the weak. Free Trade is a particular example of this. A rational person must expect the UK to be brutally savaged in dealing with the EU, US and China.
0	It’s time to turn up the heat on the EU by accelerating our post Brexit trade talks. The penny has finally dropped
0	Brexit  is a scam and a massive mistake. That I always thought was a terrible  idea and holding a referendum on it wasn’t a good idea.I  see no tangible benefits with plenty of downsides to it. I firmly  believe that the best place for the UK is being a committed member at  the heart of the EU and it is a shame that so many British people fail  to see that.
1	Staying without serious reform is also equally stupid. And the latter is not an option as the club has grown too big too quickly.
0	Can Farage or the brits understand how much Ireland wants the brits OUT of Ireland? Irony? Scotland wants you out too
1	They finally got the message.  Happy brexit day
0	During the election Jeremy Corbyn warmed us about the US hiking up medicine prices in a seedy trade deal with the UK & he was branded a liar by Tories & reporters all round.  Well Jeremy Corbyn was telling the truth. And nobody listened.
0	Voting to stay, not least because it makes the most sense politically,  economically and otherwise, but also because the leave campaign seems to  be pointing a lot of fingers without really offering solutions. It's  important to know what you stand for, not just what you stand against.   Many British ties to European have been renegotiated anyway, so a  large part of problems those in favour of Brexit seem to point out will  be resolved through that. Much of the rest of their problems are issues  like UK nationals living abroad 'draining' health care resources, which,  to me, doesn't really have too much to do with whether or not Britain  is part of the EU.
1	BREXIT, The Victory Day. Congratulations Great Britain !
1	Essentially brexit gives us democracy
1	Remain will win, with a swing induced by the Cox murder. What a travesty.

0	What a sad, sad day for the country
0	Keep that flag somewhere safe you'll be needing it again before too long. There is already the sound of much fluttering as the Brexit Turkeys circle and look to come home to roost. Many already have with jobs and investment lost, and this will continue as Bojo fails to get a meaningful trade deal and the UK economy takes hit after hit. A Nice and Accurate prophecy!
0	Recaptured sovereignty is a falsehood
0	Idiot Brexiteers heading for the biggest surprise in their stupid lives. Watch the coming months...
0	Brexit biggest mistake in UK history!!
1	I don't mind brexit
0	Doesn't seem like a great idea, but it's not my country. I like Britain and hope they do alright.
1	A no deal Brexit would be a complete failure by the government to negotiate for Britain.
1	You did it Nigel. Congrats
1	I support Brexit because that is what they voted for. Will of the people.
1	Brexit is a major opportunity.
1	The speech from Boris certainly outlines the positive intentions of his new government & ‘throws down a gauntlet’ to the EU for the forthcoming trade talks this year! We will see how things develop in the near future regarding these matters?!
0	About time. The UK doesnt need to be bound up with the rest of Europe. They are doing fine and are one of the most sought after countries in Europe for job seekers....you don't see mass immigration of Brits to elsewhere....
1	The British have chosen liberty with Brexit and can congratulate themselves every day.
1	They buy the propaganda that Britain will fall over and die if they don't give up their right to rule their own lands and keep sending money to be wasted across Europe.
1	Finally Brexit happened
1	How many times do we need to be told and how much evidence do we need. The EU have no intention of negotiating.
1	Democracy won in the end.
0	A woeful lack of understanding then since unity would be required to get an agreement especially in the time now available. Divide and conquer has served the UK well. But that time has passed
0	it’s so utterly depressing. Brexit the best example of mass manipulation of the ignorant (sorry if that offends, but there’s no other explanation) .
0	Not a single reason for Brexit that makes any sense.
0	outrageous. this will take away our choice about what to buy/eat based on where it comes from
0	Compared to all the Remain marches it's a tiny turnout. But more importantly, let it go .. it's sad how you keep banging on about it ..
0	And this time it's real. Any last minute ideas to #StopBrexit?
0	Damage WILL be reversed and those who instagated it will one day be held responsible.
1	You have a ton of support from across the pond. We can’t wait to get rid of our Democratic Party here. Keep the faith!
0	Any bad things that happen, even after the UK has left the EU, will still be because of the EU in the eyes of Brexiters.
1	So happy to leave the anti democratic EU, huge thank you to everyone that has made it happen
0	The dignity, decorum and good humour shown by the EU members is humbling, indeed embarrassing, compared with the Brexit stupidity exhibited across the U.K.
0	Tonight I am stripped of my European citizenship against my wishes... tonight I am ashamed to be British and proud to be European and I always will be
1	Enjoy your fees,bailouts and lack of individual control of your Governments and criminal prosecutions etc.
0	Congrats GB. You are free again.
0	If you're British and you haven't realized that Brexit is an attempt to isolate you from the protection of the EU so you can be put up on the auction block and sold, you're living in the same kind of delusion as trump supporters.
1	Now we need Swexit! Let the corrupt EU fall apart and let the eurocrats seek work elsewhere, they can wash dishes or clean toilets for what I care.
1	If UK leaves EU the economy will grow!
1	Today we throw off the shackles of tyranny and claim our country back.
0	I wanted to stay :(
1	All of our problems will now fall at the feet of our own elected officials, clearly indicating who needs voting out.
0	Well Johnson won’t be broke at the end of this, but I’m not so confident for the rest of us.
1	The EU needs a massive shake-up internally, as well as the added pressure supplied by an external source, and Brexit supplies both.
1	UK before EU: The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Rolling Stones, Yes, Led Zepplin, Jethro Tull, Genesis, The Kinks, ... UK in EU: One Direction Why did they wait so long to get out?
1	Make you feel proud
1	Britain's new independence day! Congratulations. Death to the EU and globalist politicians everywhere
1	The best thing about #Brexit .... Europe will be a bully-free continent...Let's hope they ban the gambling torturing war games called premier league too...
1	Leave it already.
1	Your all so lucky. I wish we have to leave the EU too
0	The Russians and USA support brexit to... divide and vonquer policy is at work
0	You lost the Brexit campaign as this will be lost.
1	Congratulations to the UK from the USA. Good for you. It's about time.
0	Over a thousand of years of building up enormous international power and influence, being sacrificed in order to be isolated in a global world.I am no historian but I dont think we have or ever will see such a strong nation just voluntarily hand over all its hard earned soft power and good will.
1	EU: goodbye and thanks for all the fish.... literally
1	Britain will be independent again we will rebuild from this occupation of libtards and we will take back what is rightfully ours
1	OOOOOOOOOOO!!! WE DID IT!!! BREXIT ALL THE WAY!!! WOOOOOOOOOO!!!...
1	The EU is far from perfect and there is a case for leaving it.
1	The EU is an organisation devoted to taking power away from the accountable level, the national government, so it can be exercised on behalf of big business.
1	We will now have true democracy once again. We will be able to take proper control of our boarders to keep out health and economic migrants, along with the bogus refugees.
0	Didn't we say this would happen? And didn't #BorisJohnson assure us it wouldn't happen? But, apparently it's going to happen. We'll, I'm shocked! #LiarJohnson #ToryBrexit
1	FREE TRADE, not ordered bu EU Eurocrats.
1	This is an actual masterpiece, it brought a tear of joy to my eye.
0	once the place to come then tory party started to piss about and not do brexit right from day 1
1	i voted leave and proud to do so
1	Lol the remainers looked like they were trying to summon a demon. They've tried everything else...
0	They may not get screwed. They may be dead before the worst of it. You know, the same plan for the past few decades regarding the environment?
0	Brexit is a failed idea from its core. People supporting it are basically supporting there own countries downfall because they are that scared of immigration.
1	Excellent Boris, at long last we have a Prime Minister that wants & will work to do what is best for our nation & citizens whilst also working with other nations. Thank you, we now have a positive future & also for future generation
0	if Brexiters don't like being called thick, maybe they should quit producing this kind of weapons grade idiocy. #BrexitCelebration
1	The day of a new future has dawned. WE will make of it what we will. The British character has never lacked the passion or capacity to deliver and we certainly won't be lacking now. Happy Independence day to all.
1	The major pro is not accepting the ideology of the EU and it’s future plans for deeper integration. The U.K. never had an appetite for this roadmap
1	Boris !! for the first time in decades, I am impressed and feel optimistic for the future of a British nation, onwards and upwards, do not take one step backwards. !!!!!
0	Leaving Europe will not mean that we are free of the rules set in Brussels; not if we wish to continue to enjoy the advantages of trading with Europe anyway. We will simply no longer have any influence over the rules that Europe sets for us.
0	So sad to say goodbye to our British friends. Always better together.
0	it's like  old story man seating on the branch and cutting it off but expecting the tree to fall down * Hmmm  let's wait and watch see if the tree goes down or the  branch with the idiot who started the Brexit for own gain
1	Finally breaking free from the chains of EU slavery, well done Boris, the country is behind you. Your the MAN !!!
0	I'll move to Scotland, see ya Britain
1	We've done it, lads. We've escaped this lunacy. #GotBrexitDone
1	#BrexitDay Free at last! Free at last!
1	Say this 5 times fast: Brexit’s Biscuit Brisket for Breakfast,
1	As far as I see it they are trying to bully us. We have helped save their lives, and poured billions into the development of Europe. Yet they are manipulating and coercing us now.
0	With Brexit, London’s financial industry access to the EU market will have more regulations and obstacles, undermining the competitiveness of London’s financial services compared to EU financial services.
1	Congratulations to the newly independent United Kingdom.
0	This is what Brexit has done. It’s brought the racist twats out into the open. This poster was put up in a block of flats in Norwich. The dregs of society are emboldened by what was always a project by the right made popular by anti immigrant lies & propaganda from Blojo’s pals!
1	Oh dear. The EU have just lost a country with the equivalent of 18 of their economies.
1	We have broke free from a dictatorship . Our Brexit vote might even bring the whole EU project down. It's not just about money. We are a great country .All the Remain voters are all arrogant big heads ,who talk down to people. I know people like you who i go to school with .These people never fight the system ,they think they are clever.But never clever enough to realise they are being controlled by the elite.
0	Unfortunately England has more than their fair share of bigots and morons.
1	Q: With Britain leaving the EU how much space was created?A: Exactly 1GB
0	tragedy. A contemptible tragedy. I hope the people who voted for Brexit are happy. At least someone will be.
1	The EU won't even be around then. Every nation wants out.
1	The decision the British people made, was, as always for us, the right one.
1	I had a smoke with nigel Farage at CPAC in 2019. Hes a good guy
1	Lots of rhetoric, however, a few facts are in order. Since joining the UK has paid in £507 billions (current value) we pay £12 billions per annum, we pay in VAT and we pay in CET. It's a racket, Ireland is richer than the UK and just takes out. The UK, after the USA is the only significant military power helping to ensure the EU's security for which we get nothing in return. Indeed if Germany paid its way it would cost them an extra €30 billions per year in military spending. So enough nonesense from the Remoaners trying to say that the EU is great it's a mess just take a look at its unemployment rates.
0	I am no longer willing to act against my own interests in order to help those who are so dead set on acting against their's. Fuck 'em.
1	Let's make Britain great again.
1	Death to the EU.
0	Now UK can trade freely... YEAH!!!! Then you forget that WTO trade tariff is based on what the country individually prefer and you need to obey them in order to reach an agreement since you're no longer can use EU tariff anymore... LOL. I think UK make a big mistake prefering Brexit seriously.
1	It's coming home, it's coming home Britain's Coming Home ✨🇬🇧🎉
0	Nonsense!! The British came all the way from Europe to west Africa and for the sole purpose of what they would gain from Nigeria, they amalgamated this useless country called Nigeria and since then we have never known peace and there is so much hate amongst the northern, southern and eastern people of this 'jungle' and now you want to break away from EU. Do you think you will know peace? I don't think so.
1	Happy Independence Day U.K !
1	Finally Breakup........
0	This will be a significant road-marker on the historical decline of GB
0	Good luck UK. I hope we and other countries stay. I love how EU makes strong safety standards, I love how I can use internet for free everywhere in Europe (except UK now). I think they will manage the imigration crisis too. Best of luck.
0	Welcome to the New Era of following EU rules without having any say in making them
0	Brexiters have offered no evidence that we will do great outside of the EU.
1	Congrats UK. Too bad you couldn't leave the BBC "news" too.
1	we will be able to do what we want
0	The economist: "Brexiteers note that 90% of world growth will be outside the EU over the next decade. Yet the government’s own analysis finds that the combined benefit of free-trade deals with America, Canada, Japan, Australia and other big countries would add less than 0.5% to GDP, a small fraction of what will be lost through more trade friction with the EU."
1	No more remoaners, we are out get over it
1	That's great.... And hopefully Scotland soon will be able to do the same to the Union Jack.
1	The beginning of the end ... the eu tried everything to prevent brexit...  the euro was a mistake.. the eu also for gb was a mistake..bye bye
0	So today is Brexit day it is also my birthday so thanks for the birthday present you right wing fascist wankers
0	If they wanted to leave EU that's ok but Brits should be greatful to be part of EU, without it they would be much much poorer now
0	First British refugees in small boats spotted near the French coast
0	So where are the UKs skilled workers? Why can’t these firms train those looking for work to do these jobs
1	UK has left the tyranny of Brussels, Happy Brexit Day!
1	The Best is yet to come !! Cheers to Freedom and sovereignty
0	The Brexit baboons will be a whooping! They are meant to be masters of their own destiny now not held hostage by the whims of any Johnny come-lately-Foreigner. No Unicorns, no cake and eat it, and now no friends, hmmm looks a lot like no future. Oh how their pyrrhic victory smells exactly like ... $h!†. Is this what Farage and Johnson promised?
0	Leavers, you live in a world of lies
0	The ugly face of Brexit.. racism and xenophobia perceived as acceptable behaviour..
0	Every empire has to hit that rock bottom sometimes. Good luck, UK people, brace for impact.
1	Still the EU  pushes ,still we push back. TERESA has gone,she wanted remain. Boris wants LEAVE. A deal will only work when BOTH parties are happy.
0	For our next trick we'll shoot ourselves in the face instead of the foot
0	The UK were given practically everything they asked for, but in the end found a union of equals an unpalatable concept.
0	I totally agree with all the points made in the article, but Simon Jenkins ultimately falls into the trap of referring to this as a 'divorce'. I've never seen a couple where one member is six times bigger than the other. As his own arguments make clear, it's just ridiculous to claim that this is a relationship between equals. But the Brexit propaganda seems to be doing a good job (again) in spreading this lie.
0	The whole of UK needs a rude awakening anyway
0	So proud of the people from my home town who do not support leaving the EU. Europe, please leave a light on for those of us who did not want #BrexitReality #IamEuropean that will not change with #Brexit
1	We are right with you Boris, only Politician we can rely on at present to deliver what we wanted, the rest are a bloody disgrace to public service. They have failed, failed and failed again.
0	I read a transcript of this. I was embarrassed for him.
1	Some of you have lost the plot. We are still european. We dont need to be part of the EU project to be European.
0	There will be no force or desire to make Brexit successful. Most Brexiteers are about to die or retire. And the other younger half of the country wants that Brexit fails and the UK to rejoin the EU.
0	I don't think we should be celebrating this. The economy is suffering and people are losing their jobs. Let's not revel in the misery of others.
0	Scotland against brexit!
0	Now that opinion polls have shifted massively in favour of REMAIN, BREXIT must be halted in its entirety by all means necessary!
0	The UK can not break away from the EU.  It can mess with the EU  And break itself.  Putin paid for both.  So did the global mafia.  #Brexit is a crime.  Every current Tory MP is complicit.  Meanwhile Nigel Farage rattles & the mafia controls the mass mood manipulation algorithms.
0	Brexit a desaster for the UK.
0	I really hope the French are utterly merciless and make the Brits pay dearly out of the nose. Like fifty percent tariffs.
1	You opened our eyes Nigel - thank you for all the years you have put in to show us how bad the EU is. Job well done.
1	Brexit was a good idea.
1	FCK EU
0	As an Irishman and a proud European the words Boris Johnston and genuine do not go together. In my opinion it’s all games and showmanship with him and worst he is playing with the Irish peace process and ultimately risking peace and people’s lives.
0	Brexit is a misguided attempt to turn back the clock to better times. Politicians are just parasites that will go in whatever direction offers them best benefits.
0	Brexitors are going to find the devil’s in the details. But like Trump supporters in US, they will continue to blame EU, never taking responsibility for the results of what they’ve done.
1	S0d Remainers.We've had three years of them wrecking the social cohesion and economy of the Country, Now's the time to unite and get deals done with that great big world out there and let the EU rot in its own protectionist, shrinking juice!
1	I'm strongly for Leave as are most of the people I know, both offline and  online. I've seen mainly Leave posters in my area (near London) and I  get a sense that we are in the majority, even despite the absolutely  shameful tactics of the Remain campaign and their allies.  The argument is a simple one for me: it is about sovereignty. It is  about liberty. It is about democracy. It is not about trinkets and  baubles.  The EU is anti-democratic, founded in the egregious civil law (say  goodbye to due process, presumption of innocence, habeas corpus, jury  trials, etc), has no concept of the rule of law, believe themselves  above the law, and is ruining Europe economically.   National sovereignty is hard to come by and even harder to keep. We  have not fought and bled over centuries to defend it just to hand it on a  plate to the EU. The planners and collaborators of this European  Project have used stealth and deceit to bring us to this point. Why, if  something be so good, would such methods be used? Think about that.  My concern is that many young people - having been fed a pro-EU  agenda through EU-funded British education institutions - no longer  understand what sovereignty is and why it is important. They have been  sold the lie of internationalism and, being ignorant of the lessons of  history, may not realise their folly until it is too late.
1	We need to expedite free trade agreements with the US, Japan, Australia and every other democracy in preference to the EU.
1	A clean Break is what the Country has waited over 3 years to hear and to know the UK will leave at the end of 2020 with or without a deal and made law is a big relief for everyone. We now know where we stand. The way now is forward
1	The only people who should have access to jobs are British citizens first and based on qualifications then other countries citizens!
1	You could have drowned in the pools created by all the melted snowflakes in Britain on 24th June 2016.  Long Live Freedom!
0	Quite right. The anti-American sentiment from some parts of the British public is petty and embarrassing.
1	I voted to stay now I know more I wish I wouldâ€™ve voted to leave
0	Congrats UK for committing economic suicide.
0	Now you have finished UK
0	I assume that the EU will be putting pressure on to Spain to give Catalonia their preferred independence.
0	There will be NO JOBS coming to the UK. So be prepared to be eating out of bins
1	Peace in EU? What's happening in Balkans? Bloody war. What's EU did? F nothing!
1	Great job UK. Globalism is a failed idea. The world is safe when all nations are strong prosperous and self dependent
0	I'm afraid that Leavers became a sect of fanatics completely resistant to the reality and truth. Absolute Teflon.
1	We have paid in over 100 billion pounds over and above what we have got back. What is our supposed benefit for this one way traffic. Now we will have a vote at last.
1	Congrats brits! American here wanting to wish you a happy Independence Day! Freedom and Security by Brits for Brits! Once again, Congratulations!!!
1	About time. The UK doesnt need to be bound up with the rest of Europe. They are doing fine and are one of the most sought after countries in Europe for job seekers....you don't see mass immigration of Brits to elsewhere....
0	I can only wish all of you in the UK who voted remain the very best, as you get dragged down the toilet of narrow-minded nationalism.
0	Johnson is very much like the orange traitor in the U.S. Glad to see him stumbling.
0	Thanks to the media supported Tory propaganda, they will be blaming Labour, EU beaurecrats, and brown and Slavic people from the East for the results of them punching themselves in the face. Don't expect self-awareness or or even them realizing who really is screwing them.
0	Brexit makes me uncomfortable. It feels like we’re in no-man’s-land, and it doesn’t feel safe. People who voted to leave did so because of the scaremongering. It was all about immigration, but immigration is a great thing.
1	We’ve lived with it both ways [inside and outside the EU] and I think a lot of people were fed up with these regulations and being ruled by people we didn’t know. People wanted to take back control.
0	Bad for UK end of
1	I think a lot of people disliked about membership of the EU is the constant (mostly gradual, sometimes not) extension of its scope, with no limit to the gradual transfer of power ("competence").
0	happy brexit day you fucking morons
0	As a British person...... I can say with confidence that I hate British people. I am sorry for all those that have to put up with us Britons 😂
0	Are leavers just pretending not to know that we’re in a transition period where nothing changes or do they genuinely not realise? #Brexit
1	bye bye , see you crawling back in a few years
0	The Pound ( £ ) HAS ALREADY FALLEN .......taking back control - Boris ?
1	The EU will struggle more than the UK that’s a fact no matter what your agenda is.
1	Feeling very energised and happy that we can move forward on becoming the Singapore of Europe. Cheer up BBC, I know you can change to include more diverse views from amongst your population base.
1	HAPPY BREXIT DAY EVERYONE!!!!! So happy its finally here #BrexitDay
1	It makes sense to get out. Why would the Britain want the rest of Europe telling them what to do? I cant stand when people try to tell me what to do.
0	Can't wait for all the old people who voted for this to watch their pensions and social programs get slowly eviscerated, and blame the youth for their political ineptitude.
0	very considered and reasonable but you dont understand 'why brexit', if you still think its possible to maintain FOM.
0	The US has fcuked many countries. Now its UK's turn. Britain bend over pls
0	Ironic that we leave at 11pm tonight because that's midnight in Europe. We're one hour behind. From tomorrow we'll be 50 years behind.
0	Unfortunately I think for a lot of Out people they feel like they have no control or ability to affect their lot and the Out campaign has done a good job selling the magic bean that is leaving the EU could be.  If we leave I fear they will just be left holding the beans whilst the country becomes further divided.
0	The US is going to be the biggest problem if we let there president into our Country on trade now we’ve left Brexit ,
1	The "people" who have been "invited" into Europe, by the globalists, are not the tolerant kind. The eussr politicians know this, but they are not aloud to say it. We all know this, and yet the great replacement is allowed to continue. Dark days ahead for Europe, the old continent. So good to be out - of the eussr, of course ... :)))
0	The British people are intelligent enough to learn from their mistakes, but the British government is not democratic enough to allow them to act upon what they have learned.
1	Ma Corgis are Ready 4 Brexit!
1	JOHNSON AND TRUMP WILL CHANGE THE WORLD 👍👍
1	Very powerful article. Remoaners should read it and be ashamed. But they probably won't. We ordinary British already
0	use ‘transition period’ not ‘implementation period’
1	Truly inspirational. If he walks the walk as good as he talks the talk Boris is destined to become one of the UK’s best PMs we’ve had since Maggie. I don’t think Barnier knows what he’s dealing with.
0	Idiots celebrating like if they won a war or sth lmao.
0	It has begun. Let it all crumble down. Burn to the ground in ashes and then rebuild. I warn ye.
0	A moment in history but I’d rather sleep through it and hope to wake up and its a bad dream…
1	Over 50% of English/ British voted LEAVE. Including me. Great victory......
0	I say again: Why aren't the media hounding BoJo  to #ReleaseRussiaReport ?  #RejoinEU #DitchJohnson #Brexit
0	One of the basic cornerstones of the European Union is its free market. That means free movement of capital as well as people. The UK would like to have the first but not the second. The UK wants to reap all the rewards but not pay any dues. Does that remind you of anything? One word: NAFTA!
0	give that EU vacant seat from post-england to Ukraine who much deserves it!
1	That's true freedom
1	Very well done Prime Minister,the people are behind you
1	Hello, I am from Britain, you know, the one that got tricked by a bus
1	The beginning of the end, for the EU. Rule Britannia!
1	I truely wish to leave, preferably today!
0	“Stop whinging and accept what’s happening!” say Brexiters who spent 47 years whinging and not acccepting what’s happened.
1	Time for Remoaners to finally admit they never really liked the EU either, in fact they barely know a thing about it, they just hate Britain (taking their lead from the BBC).
0	And yet some Brexiters still believe that the UK "holds all the cards" and that the EU will capitulate and give it what it wants.
1	Being in the EU destroys countries by removing their national sovereignty.
1	It is possible to have a trade deal done this year....I am totally convinced that the relations with the UK are stable, and after Brexit will be even better...and of course we have globally, common interests.
0	Do not dissent. Do not demonstrate. Do not allow journalists to ask questions. Do not listen to countries in the Union who disagree. Do not mention the word Brexit, do not do what's right for many who voted for you... Do what is right for your career.
1	Very biased anti Breit propaganda: disgusting!
0	For 16 months, I lived in the European Union. That was cool. Now I live on an island in the Atlantic. #Brexit #UK #Scotland
1	This is so dumb. Yes, they covered all the cons of Brexit, but the pros are way too much. Liberty above all, baby.
1	Obviously sent on date of us leaving the EU out of sheer spite and pettiness and seems very childish to me. There is nothing more to say.
0	Another victory for Vladimir Putin ...
0	let's see for how long those people will celebrate in UK
1	EU can't seem to grasp we have a Brexit supporting Government with a big majority. You're not dealing with May the Remainer any more Mr B.
1	yesss, good for your Britain
0	I won't be happy at the loss of rights and access to the EU.
0	The old and decrepit may think they have successfully stolen the futures of all the young and virtuous, but this war is far from over.
1	Sad I picture a tearful Merkel and Macron gazing at the sunset, holding hands. As for GREAT Britain   EU gone , Meghan gone, things are looking up. God bless the Brits!
1	NO DEAL has always been and always will be the BEST DEAL.
1	If we are denied Brexit again I very much fear we will start to see violence.
0	Looks like the UK's future lies in WTO terms then, good luck. I doubt that by then there will be a single car plant left in the UK. Watch out for massive unemployment, particularly in the north where they showed such confidence in the greatest con artist in the world.
0	The @BBC has become so devoid of impartial coverage of the news that it is at risk of becoming a threat to national
1	The EU never needed the UK and it was only a member to avoid another war.
0	Hence rejoining is the best option. Maybe the intervening 20 odd years will ram that message home....
1	I'm honestly optimistic about the UK'S future outside of the EU, only time will tell to see if I'm right about that
1	Brexit had better go ahead unless they want a riot
1	We will be able to take proper control of our boarders to keep out health and economic migrants, along with the bogus refugees.
1	We have become a sovereign country again after 47 years of deception by our political class, may that pave the way for freedom & justice for all, even those who opposed it, many thanks to those who stood up to the abuse, your efforts have been rewarded!
1	If we had not joined we would still have a large fishing industry we would still have profitable coal industry and we would still have a steel industry, we would not have stupid rules like straight bananas and cucumbers
1	Boris has unveiled his canons and fired a distancing shot! Good speech! Determined, clear but cheerful and reasonable, he makes Barnier sound very last century.
0	History will find the old men in the Conservative Party who have planned and plotted this day with an obsession bordering on delusion responsible for a very large step down in the history of our nation. Our economic health, our civic life, the life chances of young people and our status on the world scene will be diminished. A shameful episode.
1	Finally!!!
1	The men of remain should hang their heads in shame.
1	We across the pond are very proud of you. Enjoy your Independence!
1	We'll have our cake and eat it , the eu dictatorship is now irrelevant
0	Damn sight simpler to stay than to leave, that’s for sure. And better for our futures. What’s not to like? #RevokeArticle50
1	CONGRATS UK on Exiting the SOCIALIST BREXIT!! "They may take away our lives, but they'll never take our FREEDOM!!!"
0	I genuinely believe a leave vote will go down as the worst mistake in British history when generations look back on this event.  Edit: Some of my reasons for staying:  1) Better employment rights: minimum paid annual leave (currently at 28 days)  2) The current pregnant and paternity leave rights. May not be perfect but it's improved.  3) Fighting equal pay across the sexes.  4) Anti- discrimination rules in the workplace   On the above 4 points it has been noted that the UK didn't want. I'm  not saying the above laws wouldn't have happened anyways, but they may  have occurred later (if at all), if the UK got its way.  5) Thanks to the EU roaming fees are a lot less. I don't have to buy a  new SIM card each time I visit a European country and then inform  everyone of a temporary new number. Businesses don't have to suffer as a  result of having to change numbers in the midst of a deal when they go  abroad. People at home can much easily contact you in an emergency as  they can just message/call your existing mobile number. People who  aren't aware you are abroad can still get in contact with you via phone  if need be.   6) Standardisation of phone chargers. I imagine this would have  happened eventually, but it was forced by the EU. All radio equipment  (such as mobiles, locating beacons, cameras) are supposed to now use a  micro usb. Think of the times you've not had a charger and needed one?   7) Schengen.   8) Ability to go anywhere in the EU to work and live freely with  ease. If I wanted to work in France I am to be treated exactly as their  home citizens, and not be disadvantaged by being foreign.  9) You can retire anywhere in Europe and still claim a British pension.  10) whilst abroad I can receive emergency healthcare for free via the EHIC scheme.  11) If I encounter flight delays or cancellations whilst in the EU,  airlines have to compensate and accommodate me. This is not true (I  believe) of the USA.   12) As an EU citizen if I face trouble abroad and cannot find a  British embassy I am entitled to turn up at any EU embassy and they have  to provide consular services.  13) The EU has introduced a number of consumer rights (the  aforementioned cap on roaming fees) and a two year garuntee on all  products. If we were to leave the EU, Chinese manufacturers may not make  products sent to the UK to the same standard of the rest of the EU.   These may not be arguments based on the economy or immigration and  I've deliberately tried to stay away from that. I'm looking at things  that affect me on a day to day basis and that is why I said my  statement.
1	Almost there, folks! #GetBrexitDone
0	we will be able to do what we want' - something tells me that won't be the case
1	About time. The UK doesnt need to be bound up with the rest of Europe. They are doing fine and are one of the most sought after countries in Europe for job seekers....you don't see mass immigration of Brits to elsewhere....
1	Insult us all you like. We are british. And we are leaving the EU.
1	UK never fully embraced the EU anyway.  Didn't switch to the Euro and many other things.
1	The EU is a fundamentally corrupt organisation. Not so very different to FIFA. As a businessman, exporting product worldwide, I can assure you all that life outside the EU will improve our trading position, help our economy grow, secure our borders and put the G back into Great Britain.
1	Still have to laugh at the the tedious and odious remoaners on here who think they can reverse Brexit. You tried all the underhanded tactics you could and failed. You can burn your EU flags , as you won't be needing them again.
0	Make Britain Great Again!
1	EU lost its great asset now that the UK has decicided to finally leave the failed EU after four decades of committed British membership that has been one of the EU strongest nations. The vote to leave the EU will release the UK from a highly demanding EU membership instead shifts into a total UK focus of efforts, Finances , resources and people that have been previously provided to the EU . The massive annual investments made by the UK can be available for Britains sole benefit which increases the British capabilities to tackle issues, produce wide ranging positive outcomes for British citizens and help the enhancement of uk society in many ways promoting better quality of life for all British people. The UK will also produce returns in benefits, needs meeting and advantages for all people in uk
1	This is a great day, Britain is an independent sovereign state once again, come what may and it might get a little rough we are free from the shackles of the EU. Free to run our own country.
1	Happy Brexit Day to UK Freedom from EU dictators Congratulations
0	A new referendum would make them stay
1	Shut up and go back to your country. You dont belong in EU.
1	After 3 years of remoaner moaning, lies and project fear even if it was  true no one would believe them. Who would you trust most the US or some  of these tupenny halfpenny EU countries that have only just got electric  and the telephone?.
0	Sad to be British today; we were once respected the world over for pragmatism and tolerance.  We are about to start the only trade talks in history where the starting point is free trade and we are going to discuss what barriers we put up.  You couldn't invent it!!! Churchill will be turning in his grave.
0	Use your brain and vote Remain fellow UK citizens! Bremain 2016
0	Farage and his crew are an embarrassment to our country. Appalling man!
0	Good luck negotiating with every country on the planet that will try to scam you every which way from Sunday.Monty Python couldn't have made this up.ENGLAND FOR THE ENGLISH!!!!!
0	I know it's not at the top of everyone else's list but there's one topic which never gets enough coverage in this debate: UK citizens like me who live and work in the EU. I read the other day that there could be 2 million of us. Many of us would be at risk of losing our jobs and homes, and needing to arrange complex paperwork for spouses and families just to repatriate (which, incidentally, is not something I want to do). It feels like we're faced with the choice of applying for citizenship in our host countries or risk losing everything. Quite apart from that, imagine the pressure on the job market, etc, if many of us are forced to return.
1	The EU was a bad idea from day one!!
1	A GREAT DAY FOR THE UK!!! CHEERS MATES!
1	Most people just want to get out. According to a ComRes poll for ITN (with a massive pool of 26,000 people, far larger than for a normal poll), 54 per cent of respondents wanted Brexit delivered.
0	Aww welcome to the democracy btw.
0	It's a fucking travesty
1	Wipe the tears and get on with it now. Stop looking back and look forward. Pathetic to see what they did with that big ben clip lol what a joke. Sick of the cry babies of the last 4 years.
0	In a long period term they can’t compete with the economic power of China, Russia, India, Brazil alone so they won’t never leave UE.
0	I know it's not very "politically correct" to say it out loud but in the wasteland of ruined Britain I am going to hunt and eat old people
0	Hold lying Boris to account for all the Brexit lies!
0	Sad day for the UK, if it even remains the UK for much longer. Truly upsetting that ignorance and deliberate disinformation is becoming the norm in critical domestic and international decision-making across the globe.
0	Has anyone considered what the EU would be like if the UK became a proactive EU member instead of just moaning about cucumbers and immigrants? As the article points out the majority of immigrants are from outside the EU which is a bit inconvenient and cucumbers - Jesus. For me, the best things about the EU are freedom of movement, the near impossibility of major war and the security it brings by being part of 450m people. How can you put a price on that?
0	no deal is looking more and more beautiful 30% tariffs on everything from Europe
1	Wow! So Brexit has finally arrived. The shackles are finally off. I do hope this bold moves eventually leads to a better and stronger Britain. Congratulations.
1	The U.K. should tell the EU what deal they want and give a dead line to reply. If the answer is not to our complete satisfaction we leave immediately on WTO rules.
0	It's hilarious and sad at the same time watching these people cheering about leaving EU like watching a friend who is quickly eating hamburger with super hot sauce without thinking what's gonna happen next
0	How soon before Scotland and Northern Ireland separate from the UK
1	So now the EU can damage itself to destruction and the UK can move on unscathed as part of the free World.
1	happy Brexit day everybody
1	UK will NOT regret it, no one has ever regretted more freedom and liberty.
0	The EU has to be strong and make the UK an example of it - with all this love going and whatever, let us remember the lies used by the Leave campaign. The UK wants to leave, then there is a price to pay. The UK was in the EU with many opt-outs. The EU cannot let the UK now have many opt-ins.
1	Way to go PM. Slowly, slowly inch your way to an agreement in our favour. That is the whole object of this exercise. Exactly as it will be for the EU. Back in the day it was called negation.
0	There will be NO JOBS coming to the UK.   So be prepared to be eating out of bins.  Boris Johnson is a YANK.
0	The beginning of the end of a UNITED Kingdom. Scotland will (re)join and Irland will become stronger and more influential.
0	A day to celebrate Brexitland's imaginary freedom from an imaginary oppressor thereby embracing xenophobia and empowering the xenophobes.
0	Boris the coward didn't even venture outside No 10 last night.
1	Good job Prime Minister. You and your allies delivered on your promise. Thank you!
1	He can brutally slap whoever he wants, fact is we are in very weak position compared to the EU and any feeble slaps we can deal are unlikely to be felt.
1	To be clear, you can't be #probrexit and not #ProBreakUp, the arguments are almost identical.
1	I would like to see economic reform where one person’s wealth isn’t the debt of another’s, and people are rewarded for their contribution rather than what they can extort from others through rents and fines.  I’d like an economy where growth is genuine, which potentially means overhauling the whole banking system. I would like the bank to be disempowered from creating money and those powers going to central government, albeit a government whose aim is to represent its citizens rather than control them. The money supply should not be held in private hands.  Politically, I would like to see Brussels and Westminster reformed, and arrogant politicians and public servants begin to serve public needs and not be bought like prostitutes by vested interests. Eventually, under the right circumstances, I would like to see us return to the EU, with more visionary and ideologically driven representatives that are forced to make themselves accountable to both their home population and the wider European population. Europe could be a fantastic political structure that would promote the growth and needs of all its people, but not with the current political mentality.  The arrogance displayed by politicians here and all over Europe who suggest citizens are not “educated” enough to be left to decide is conceited and undemocratic. Chief among these is Jean-Claude Juncker. I am very sad we are leaving the EU, but the administration of both the EU and the UK need fundamental reform that promotes the lives of its citizens rather than loading them up with debt to pay for a defunct political and economic system. The absolutely wrong people are being put in charge of a economic and political system that no longer allows people to rise through the ranks.  Immigration would not be such a problem if the UK built homes and infrastructure and trained adequate doctors, nurses and essential workers, but politics is deliberately creating scarcity. Take housing, where landlords are being helped turn everyone into tenants while demand for homes continues to be stoked by immigration, pushing up rents and making us poorer every year. These are moves towards a return to 19th century serfdom. Although I know the government and the Bank of England are the ones pushing people down, this vote was the only way to really hurt them.
1	Don't cave in Boris, we are behind you. If you do you'll end up like the Labour party.
0	Stand United Europeans and keep enjoying the commonwealth
1	Out, out now....
0	Im voting to remain because i done want the price of my Sainsburys taste the difference edam to go up 50p. The "sovereignty" you want back never belonged to you.
1	All that's changing is that we're leaving a political structure that is wasteful, corrupt and completely unnecessary, in order for us to run our affairs.
0	This is disastrous!
0	The irony of this is that the less well educated in places like Sunderland who voted for leave will be its principal victims. Cameron needed to go he was entirely responsible for this debacle but that chump at the head of Labour needs the boot too. Watching the leave talking heads last night all cheerfully assuming the rest of EU is going to give our cake and eat it was funny and depressing. They don't seem to understand basic math. Yes about 50% of Britain's imports come from Europe but that's divided between 27 countries while our reciprocal 46% comes from one.
0	United you stand. Divided you go extinct.
0	It's been three and a half days since we left the EU, surely someone out there must have encountered a benefit of brexit by now!
0	There's millions of us. We're regrouping. We remain proEuropean. The country will not unite. All you had to do was keep the Brexiteers to their campaign promises and there would have been no argument. But you fucked up with WTO.
1	Dump the EU then watch it collapse we don’t need to pay and have them making our laws, one armed forces, one flag, one currency I like our flag our currency and most of all our own rules.
0	I am disgusted at how the British MEP’s behaved, the other countries expressed sorrow but also how much the British have done for the Europe and then sang ol Lang syne, while our MEP’s made it all about them and the British, flaunting laws and basically saying good riddance... they should have shown respect not nationalist guff. A very sad day.
0	Today marks the start of a new error in Britain’s history
0	This is what they do in banana republics. It seems we are heading in that direction!
0	Personally, I didn't notice any real change. He was still talking rubbish, still lying, still obfuscating. Yeah, business as usual!
0	UK exiting European Union so they can officially become the 51st American state
1	That's the spirit. Make sure that they are equipped with some sort of mechanism to sink pirate ships. The French fish raiders can be very violent.
1	THe UK HAS LEFT THE EU  YIPEEE!
1	I'm voting to leave although neither side has really left me with  sufficient information to make an informed decision. I'm really curious  to see what would happen if we do leave and see which side is right.  The main reason why I want to leave is because we're actually having a  referendum. If leaving was actually going to leave us in the financial  turmoil that the remain campaign is saying that we will have if we leave  then we wouldn't be having a referendum in the 1st place.  David Cameron keeps saying that we can do this and that in the EU and  that we have influence. Then why was he laughed at when he tried to  negotiate a better deal for us within the EU? If that's how the EU  reacted when we threatened to leave then what makes him think that if we  remain with them they'll suddenly give us what we want? Barely anyone  from the EU has even bothered to give their 2 cents or ask us to stay  which is weird because we put in a lot of money to the EU and we take in  a lot of migrants, they should care but most of them haven't shown that  they do.  The leave campaign aren't perfect either but at least they're trying  to fix the problems that we have in this country. I hate almost all of  the leading figures for both sides but when watching the debates I agree  with a hell of a lot more points that the leave campaign says than the  remain campaign.
1	No Deal Hard Brexit is on its way. You can do it UK!!!
1	Why did we join the EU in the first place
0	Not being funny but a sandwich at my college normally cost £3 now it's going to be £5 bloody hell
0	Can't wait for all the old people who voted for this to watch their pensions and social programs get slowly eviscerated, and blame the youth for their political ineptitude.
0	The minute you define brexit in meaningful terms, it loses its majority.
0	Before the 1980s no one could sell non German beer in Germany, for example, because it didn't comply with their restrictive manufacturing protocol.
1	We’re out !!!! We’re out !!!!! Time for the UK to sail onto a bright future .
0	Make European "Soviet" Union again
0	This is an example of “don’t fix something that isn’t broken”
1	VOTED TO LEAVE THE EU - NOT STAY INSIDE IT
1	Europe lost Britain i think.
0	Honestly, what unique assets does the UK have that will cause every country to beat a path to the negotiating table? I'm puzzling.
1	Today is a day to put all the battles behind us. All the divisions behind us. For everyone to come together. Let us celebrate and make the best of our future as Great Britain
0	let's see for how long those people will celebrate in UK
0	Appealed to their most base instincts - fear and racism
1	It’s about time some reality was put into our dealings with the EU. Their untenable belief that we desperately need to cling on to their coat tails is based on remoaner angst and encouragement. They need to understand that a trade deal is neither essential or desperately required. I do hope they are listening.
0	British will pay a heavy price coming soon
1	Watch us go from strength to strength without the shackles
0	No deal is better than May’s deal.
1	Dodged a whole salvo of bullets by leaving the Ponzi pyramid scheme.
0	Brexit is having a wee in the middle of the room at a house party because nobody is talking to you, and then complaining about the smell.
0	I'm ashamed to be british
0	Bloody idiots, dont know whats coming
1	I hope May's deal is voted down. The only acceptable outcome is a no-deal Brexit.
1	Patriotism is our strength!
0	Johnson's plans are quite patently NOT a realistic attempt at any compromise. Its all smoke and mirrors. He wants to crash out, because even though it will devastate the economic well being of a huge number of ordinary people, it will benefit his mega wealthy hedge fund backers!
1	The whole furore we hear from the EU is based merely on their fear of losing control - control freaks one and all...
0	Brexit is like watching a car crash in super-super-SUPER-slowmo.
0	Democracy is under attack: They lied, cheated & broke the law to win the referendum. Funnelled £Millions into pro #Brexit propaganda ads. Now they restrict access of the press to government briefings. This is an Orwellian nightmare!
0	As a continental I am relieved to see that the gullible Brexiteers are in the minority and the British public can see through the lies and false media
1	Great Britain was once a great empire. Don't let the EU drag you down
0	Yes, Scotland has taken your place at the grown ups table.
0	Uk: we´re stronger alone Scots: ok we´ll leave the uk then UK: no no together we´re stronge
1	Congratulations to the UK! You have finally broken free of the EU talons. Live Free or Die.
1	The way they behave, I wouldn't want to have a deal with them!  No deal sounds good to me!
0	We will never get behind brexit because we know who is behind Brexit, and we want nothing to do with it.
0	You're never a loser until you quit.
0	This circus reminds me the last scene of ‘Finding Nemo’, when all the fish were happily free from Darla (EU) but trapped in the plastic bags with NO DAMN CLUE of what to do next
0	This is a deliberate and wilful act of self harm- there is nothing less patriotic than Brexit.
0	Brexit is a negative movement
0	You'll still have your cup of tea, teddy bears, and the Queen.
0	I find it really sad most of all. Because it seems like a such a clusterfuck of a situation with no winners.
1	We are out!!!
0	Wonderfull to see such a great demonstration now that we know the damage Brexit will do
1	Brexit, , while moderately painful to both member's and western economies, at least in the short run, will enable the world economy to better weather the eventual and inevitable collapse of the entire EU structure. Former Czech President Vaclav Klaus has been predicting this for many years,  and every year his data grow more robust.   .
1	I don’t want the country my family died fighting for to be controlled by the countries that surrendered or tried to occupy us
1	We voted out, its a simple equation.
1	ROFL- the people have spoken, yet again, in the December 2019 election.
1	We need Brexit to happen.
0	No matter what happens, Boris and his like will not have to suffer any consequences. Their wealth and privilege insulate them from any damage they cause. They neither know nor care how anyone else will be affected.
1	Brexit has saved Britain from EU immigrant hell.
0	This all reminds me of that last scene in Finding Nemo, where the fish in plastic bags finally managed to get in the sea, but still trapped in their plastic bags. "Now what?"
0	The bloodshed is going to come back and it's all your fault
0	I won't stop using #Brexit. I'll keep reminding #LiarJohnson  of his false promises, and his corruption & criminality in pursuit of the impossible.
0	Since 11pm, 29 March 2019, the UK has paid the EU £9,247,930,237.05. This could've paid for 102 new hospitals, 402,083 nurses, 350,951 policemen, or even the repair of 174,489,249 potholes. A single pile of what we've paid in £20 notes would be 32.47 miles tall. #BrexitBetrayal
0	This is a MAJOR blow to the one world Government of the New World Order! YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	The beginning of the end of the eu
1	I'm voting to leave. The Eurozone is ready to implode and we would be best  off distancing ourselves from the fallout. Remember the shit show about  Greece defaulting on their debts? When Italy or Spain defaults(as they  are likely to do) it will be a different story.   In addition, I'm a believer in small government. The further away  from the common man our leaders are, the more complacent they will  become. Getting rid of the EU seems a good way to even the odds
1	In comparison to the United States we don't share a common past and we don't have a single flag to be proud of. There's too much rivalry and suspicion between countries.
1	This is first piece on video that has tapped into the real anger about British membership of the EU . People feel they are second class citizens in their own land and they do not like being ignored whilst mass migration is imposed upon them. They voted leave because they want at least the semblance of democracy back. Under the EU there is no democracy. If Brexit is sabotaged as seems likely by Theresa May that anger will transfer to social unrest or worse. Leave means leave that it.
1	No the best way to fight the EU is leave it ,and watch it destroy itself when everyone else leaves.
1	REALLY A GREATER AND HISTORICAL MOMENT FOR UK FUTURE. CONGRATULATION FOR THIS TREMENDOUS AND SUCCESSFUL ACHIEVEMENT.
0	This is the end of the United Kingdom.
0	From this day on, dear leavers, it’s all your fault.
1	I'm for Brexit despite the fact it's more popular for young people my age  to vote remain. I'd first start by saying both campaigns have been  atrocious and I think everyone on both sides mutually understands this  which is why it's been so hard for some people to make a decision  without seeing a balanced argument.  The reasons I have for voting Brexit are:  We don't have full control of our own laws and quite frankly the  EU is not democratic. We cannot remove any of these ridiculous 5  presidents they have in the EU making laws which govern us, which is a  serious flaw. Part of democracy is being able to hold our officials  accountable and remove them from power. Remain does acknowledge this but  argues that we should stay in to still have a seat at the negotiating  table so to speak, well we only have 13% of the vote and as more  countries join the EU we lose influence. Quite frankly the other  countries will vote for what benefits them most which for much of the EU  that is poorer it is usually not in our best interests.I mentioned more countries joining the EU, and that's an issue.  Turkey is on the fast track to joining the EU, and as far as I'm  concerned this poses a threat to the UK. Turkey has supposedly got  flawed border security and there's been lots of reports of buying ISIS  oil etc and in general supporting them, regardless of that fact if you  look at /r/worldnews it gets saturated with the shit Erdogan does. Having Turkey join means free movement into the UK which I don't want.Remain says we'll plunge into recession leaving and most  financial institutes agree with this. Well no shit, who'd have thought  dissolving our EU membership and trade deals would have an impact on our  economy? Of course it will but let's be honest people are self  interested and the UK is the 5th largest economy currently. So many  other countries will want to trade with us because it's beneficial to  them. If you look at some of the people who endorse remain/leave you'll  see they mostly have business interests either in the EU or outside it  which financially motivates their vote. In addition, Europe is a  stagnating economy; It has the slowest rate of economic growth over any  other continent. I believe in the long term with new trade deals in  Asia/South America we'd be better off in the long run but we would have a  period of recession first.The NHS is quite the political football at the moment. On the one  hand the migrants who come here do the NHS a great service and are the  backbone of our healthcare system. I'd be concerned with losing many of  them but I would expect we will focus on allowing in skilled migrants to  work in the NHS and also encouraging more Brits to enter into  healthcare, albeit hard to do with the Jeremy Cunt fiasco. So I have  faith we'd be able to populate it with enough workers. By leaving I hope  we'd be able to both membership fee money on the NHS and also avoid  being forced into TTIP.Immigration needs to be controlled. If we maintain unstable rates  of growth it puts too much pressure on public services as well as  things we also have issues with at the moment, like housing.  Additionally the current free movement is biased against the rest of the  world. Any unskilled worker from the EU can come to the UK over say a  skilled engineer from Korea or Japan. It's said a lot but we do need a  points based immigration system like Australia. A lot of the lefties  jump at calling it racist or saying we have a humanitarian duty to take  in more people but quite frankly it isn't racist it's common sense, and I  agree we should help people as much as we can but if you look at the  European immigration crisis the vast majority of people who have come to  EU countries are economic migrants who aren't from Syria, they're from  northern Africa or elsewhere in the Middle East. I feel we should focus  on fixing problems in our country first before helping other people.  I'll leave this for now because It's reaching the point where I'm  ranting about problems but these should give an idea of the way I'm  thinking. For the most part I avoided using facts/figures because quite  frankly they get thrown around all over the place and no one really  knows what's going on.
0	I love Europe and I loved the freedom we once had to just pop in from time to time. Personally, Brexit has meant that my future career plans are very much balanced on a knife edge.
0	If you are celebrating this. Shame on you #BrexitCelebration
0	1/3 of small businesses are considering leaving the UK because of this mess. It would cause utter chaos and a recession greater than anything seen in UK history.
0	Dear UK, Close your eyes and brace for economic impact...
1	To the EU, tick tock ! Well done Boris on a great speech.
1	What could be better than a Europe full of individual and proud nations. The EU has effectively destroyed this.
1	Bout time
1	USA and UK should also get out of NATO the other countries is basically leeching off USA and UK
0	It is wrecking lives; has led to a surfacing of racism, xenophobia and violence; and will cause misery.
0	Absolute insanity. Why would any rational person want to jeopardize their own freedom of movement in Europe? Is it really worth the time and effort to divorce one’s country from the entire European economic community just to keep immigrants out?
0	This is going to cost Britain SO many billions.
0	You and the Tory party have broken the country in two, divided families, risked the break up of the UK and degraded our economy. You will never be forgiven. History will label you as a ambitious fool completely out of your depth.
1	A great achievement for democracy and liberty. The EU is a zombie now.
1	Money talks , a Billion a month is a lot to lose , for nothing in return . So , who would cut off ther nose to spite there face . I for one wouldnt , stay as long as you like, so long as the money keeps coming in .
1	Congrats on your new found freedom UK
1	Well done Boris the sense of freedom is overwhelming I cannot wait for the future and the prosperity that will Come. Brexit got done
0	Brexiteers should now be called "Loyalists"
1	It is so good the UK doesn't need EU workers good that brexit is going to stop them coming over and taking our jobs, no shortage of farm workers, hospital staff or workers needed in industry. It is time the brexit supporters wake up and stop running down our country, stop brexit or have an informed reforendum before it is too late
0	Most economists think that Brexit will harm the economy. But the Brexiteers don't listen to the experts.
1	Bravo United kingdom!!!!! You did it, you have your independence back!!!! And your democracy back!!!!!
1	Off and go! Never come back as we do not need you
1	Boris got Brexit done...
0	These Pro-Brexit people have empire on the brain. Those days are gone.
0	What a disgrace. Leaving the EU for incredibly futile reasons that wont' be fixed anyways.   This will be seen as the mistake of the century.
0	What does it mean? it means 48% of the population must go ahead with something they don't want. This kind of Democracy is broken
1	Brexit Must come.
0	I think we’ll live to regret it in a few years’ time. They’re (the EU is) our closest neighbors so we want to get closer to them, not further away from them, it’s just common sense,
1	I dislike being a constant money pig for the union.
0	Britain was a powerful player because it was made rich and powerful by its empire. Now that the empire is gone so is its power. That's not hating the country it's an acceptance of the reality of where we are.
1	I think England will not , but definitely The north of Ireland and Scotland Will, some rumbling in Wales also , but that could be just them singing,!?
0	Germany and France dominated the EU the UK was ignored and belittled. Thank God we're going.16,141,241 bitter, angry, vengeful people in the UK tonight. I'm one off them. If you think bloated Boris can simply demand unity and healing then he's deluded. Britain is poised to once again become the poor man of Europe. The NHS is in server jeopardy along with the car, farming and service industries. Idiots voted for this and idiots can own it. Never surrender.
0	Fuck brexit
0	I reminded DUP that Brexit isn't cause for celebration,but means negative economic impacts
1	I was never a Eu citizen I have never held a passport I have always been a subject of the queen
0	Still not heard one tangable benefit  of us leaving.  And I see that ' experts' are back in fashion again. It's all one big fat Tory con
1	OUTSTANDING! Another direct hit to the global socialists.
1	Brexit is going to set London free and the city will rejoin the first world.
1	I say they should leave. The attitude of UK has always been of wanting the economic benefits with none of the responsibilities.
0	The final nail in the coffin for a country which once was the “greatest” empire on earth.
1	Bank of England Governor admits there are risks to staying in EU. Safer option to #VoteLeave and #TakeControl
1	Mr Johnson is rated the best prime minister by 43 per cent of respondents, compared with a measly 21 per cent for Mr Corbyn
0	The pound will fall. Forget higher exports due to a low quid. Who outside Blighty wants Marmite? And what else is there to export? Imports will increase in costs though, causing inflation. Who will suffer the most? The ones with a tight budget already.Thanks Boris. Highly appreciated.
0	The bottom line is that the U.k. would be on the way to becoming a third world country if it were to leave the E.U.
0	Getting Brexit done is worse than making an IKEA bed.
1	We voted OUT to get rid of those parasites,
0	Bloody Brexiteers don't care if they destroy us all because of their xenophobia :(
0	This will cause instability in the UK and EU
0	England will be left alone and bare to petition for re-entry to the EU. What you voted for is only an interregnum.
1	Good job, this is "Democracy" at its finest.
0	I believe the EU is a great thing
1	They get to control their own destiny regarding foreign policy currency and immigration
1	It's a great day for democracy.
0	EU goods&food will cost more as the Queen's tariffs make herdRich (Y) as UKunemployment rises...
0	UK has left the EU team, running away like cowards from shaping the future of our continent.
0	I can’t yet vote, and am completely furious with the result. Sixty-four per cent of my town’s votes were counted for leave, and I don’t think I have ever been so disappointed. Almost everything that made Britain great came from being a part of the structure of the EU, and I feel as if casual racism and colloquial xenophobic reactions to immigrants have blinded so many people to the extent in which they would rather rid immigrants than anything else …there were so many benefits of being in the EU that people took for granted, and by the time they notice it’ll already be too late. I feel scared for the future of the economy and the future of our country too. I am not feeling proud to be British, and I think that the majority of my demographic feel similarly.
1	the UK has been around for 1000s of years, but the common market or the EU nearly destroy it in just over 50 years
1	Change can cause hardships but change is inevitable, the eu was causing hardship and could have got much worse.
0	There are no good personal Brexit stories. And there won't be any
1	No deal is the worst possible deal
1	Europe needs the EU. Without it the French and Germans would be tearing each other apart as they did in recent history. The UK doesn't need Europe.
1	Brexit will be damaging., both at a national level, and I will and have already been personally impacted.  I was in favour of leave then and I still am.
0	EU is the Best concept for Europe. An United Europe is good for the Europe and the World. If EU is gone...Russia and China will start their dirty game. So better that EU must exist.Sure it has some problems...but that can be Solved
0	I've never understood why the UK would join the EU in the first place. It is like after fighting France, Germany, Spain and others for centuries, the UK surrendered a big chunk of their sovereignty to them without firing a shot.
0	Brexit is a catastrophy. Britain has re-achieved its "little island floating in the sea near Europe" status. No thanks to the little no-brainers who voted for it.
0	You can wave your little flags around while the rich plan to pick your pockets.
0	I voted remain...
0	I still don't understand what the Brexiters think they've 'won'. We lose our EU travel and voting rights, we lose access to EU medical care and we lose access to one of the biggest trading blocks in the world. Ordinary folk lose 'freedoms' and gain nothing. Brexit is a massive confidence trick played by the rich for their own benefit and it will be up to the next generation to clean up the mess!
1	The problem with Europe is the inflexibilty of the EU itself.
1	Congratulations Britain’s, you have kept your very unique identity, three cheers!!! slap the living hell out of your millennials and press on.
0	Scotland: "We will now be an indenpent country and no longer part of the UK."
0	I’m ashamed to be British. We are officially a laughing stock, divided, leaderless and if that represents our political spectrum and clergy, I’m emigrating.
1	I want to see the EU project fall apart. It does more harm than good, it won't be reformed, it's not democratic and it has frankly been a sinking ship for a while now. The last time there were bailouts, it was widely acknowledged that future bailouts were inevitable and all they served to do was kick the can down the road for a eurozone that is fundamentally flawed.  Almost every beneficial agreement from being inside the EU can and will most likely remain in place. The difference is now we can act in our own self interest. As an example, switzerland is outside the EU but is part of the single market, one of the stipulations being free movement of people. However, when there was the migrant crisis they simply said "fuck it" and closed their borders. Many other European countries wished they could have done the same but simply lacked the freedom to do so.  I would go as far as to say the average British person does not think Multi-culturalism is a good thing or that what people call "isolationism" is a bad thing. This is different from racism but the left will paint it however they will. A 2013 poll by British Social Attitudes said 77% of voters endorsed reducing immigration. If the left wants to label 77% of the British public as ignorant racists they can go right ahead.
0	In 1946 Britain's most famous son Winston Churchhill called for a United States of Europe. The man must be spinning in his grave.
0	A sluggish Brexit economy with low consumer confidence and with less money in people's pockets.
0	I'm heartbroken. A deeply sad day, which historians shall cite as the extraordinary moment a minority of a population "won" the right to strip their children of their own future. Baffling.
0	If we were not part of the EU, we'd get no say whatsoever in EU-wide issues...that's a terrible position to be in.
1	The EU is expensive and corrupt.
1	Remainers have just ceased to exist! Happy Brexit, my dear fellow Brexiteers. We kept the faith, we fought and we won.
0	First British refugees in small boats spotted near the French coast while Boris johnson wants to put the Reliant Robin back in production to as answer on a demand of real British cars
1	When will some on the left wake up and realise the EU works in the interests of corporations.
0	At least my taxes are paying to keep you all alive to see the catastrophic results.
1	Get out of EU ASAP as our kids will struggle to find jobs with the amount of people coming to this country and I’m sick to death of hearing loads foriengers speaking there own language outside my little girls school
0	As normal the remainers are trying to fight democracy because they lost but if they won, they’d be kissing democracies feet
0	Can they change their minds and rejoin later, once they sober up?
0	Have not been on here for a while, but it is no surprise the usual Brexit extremists and anarchists still try to spread their anti EU rubbish. Then also those still completely ignorant of what a calamity they voted for, duped into voting leave by a clown who we now incredibly have as PM. The lunatics really are running asylum.
1	The only part of the EU that is elected is the European parliament
1	Bye Bye EU Socialist!
0	Perhaps the Global Little Britain fantasists will realise that the trio of the Union's biggest players could dominate the future of the Union for decades to come but they thought they had no chance to outsmart France and Germany so the only thing they could do is surrender and cut and run.
0	So guernsey fisherman banned french boats from U.K. waters not realising they have to take their fish to France to be pro
1	Atleast we can now see wether or not it is good for the UK to leave once and for all, because then other countries will know from their (UK) experience
1	best thing that ever happened to the UK, the future is bright
1	Thank the Good Lord. Welcome home Britain to who you and your awesome people are. It's now time to get busy reclaiming your sovereignty for yours and your next generations. MAKE BRITAIN GREAT AGAIN !!!!
0	The UK is now in more danger of becoming a vassal state of the EU than ever it was before.
0	You can check out any time you like, But you can never leave!
1	Good it's about time this country stood up for itself instead of giving in all the time.
0	I thought that the EU was reformable, UK sovereignty unimportant, and that I would be better off in.
0	I'm shaking with anger and sadness here in Vienna, Austria. England's xenophobia has stolen my EU Citizenship and part of the identity I have created here with my family and friends
0	Brexit is not ideal.
1	UK has 460.000 sq miles of seas. No wonder EU is panicking about being kicked out. They should not be allowed to use even a fishing rod in our waters having plundered freely for 48 years imo. 100 of 120 coastal constituencies voted leave.
0	They aren't foreigners, they are fellow Europeans.
0	It's all on Brexiters, now. The people who lied and propagandised for Brexit, and the people who voted for it.  Still no coherent plan.  I bet you wished you'd lost.
1	I don't mind them working here, if they pay their way, work hard and aren't here illegally then they are British people. It's the illegals and the EU power lords which piss me off.
1	to bad for the muslims the EU has been shoving down the throats of the people of Britain
1	Why not send the EU our annual welfare bill for the 5 million EU migrants that live here and knock that off the amount...?
0	If you're having a "Brexit party" tonight, then you are deffo a nonce of the lowest order. Get fucked.
1	Congrats UK! We are very happy for you. <3
0	I'm not a smart person, I've tried to stay abreast of this entire thing, but some things slip through my understanding, but I have to wonder doesn't the EU hold all the cards in this? What do we have to use as a bargaining tool?
0	The younger the individual, the more likely they voted Remain. It's time for Remainers to look around and determine if maybe their future lies on the continent. Berlin, Amsterdam, Barcelona and so many other cities big and small will welcome you. Brexit is going to have long-term negative consequences for Britain but the people who voted for it will be either dead or enjoying their retirement checks for it to make a difference to them. Come live in a country where the Murdoch media machine doesn't exist. You won't regret it.
0	The little nation packed full of reactionaries with delusions of past grandeur will get what it wished for and well deserves, it will finally stand alone.
1	Excellent! Well done Great Britain! Bright and better future ahead. More control over everything. It’s up to the government now to make the right decisions
1	It took a man to liberate Britain from the EU tyranny.
1	The hilarious thing about this is the truth has a way of reaching the light of day and when Brexit ends up being a huge disasters as it likely will be i certainly would not want to be the party the pushed it.
0	Far from the quick and easy exit that Leave campaigners once promised, Brexit has become mired in its own internal contradictions.
0	I’m a Remainer. But even I accept the result . But I will say may your god help us
0	The UK has been as poisoned by the Murdoch's a America has. Extremely depressing...
1	Happy Brexit Day one and all
0	Brexit is stupidity for a country with 53 percent of its exports going to the Continent and to the rest of Europe. It’s even so stupid that Britain’s best friends, the U.S., don’t understand it all.
0	Why would anyone say #Brexit, now that #BrexitReality has finally come? #BrexitJohnson's & #BrexitFarage's #BrexitLies are water underneath the bridge, and even if #BrexitNotDone yet because EU rules still apply during #BrexitTransationPeriod, who needs #Brexit? #NoBrexit!
1	Thanks God!! I was worried, they will never leave!
0	The EU has been trashed over the last 10 years with the financial crisis and it survived. What threats does it face to make it break up?
1	Get the hell out of the EU, they will play you for years to come.s Get the hell out !
0	This is a very very bad not good day for Britain
1	M.E.G.A. Make England Great Again.
1	If we vote to stay, I will give up hope for this country
0	Brexit was a fantastic example of a nation shooting itself full in the face.
0	Hi, it is right that the UK leaves the EU while some of the UK politicians are unscrupulous enough to fool their own people with services like Cambridge Analytica. Hopefully the UK will not cut all kinds of standards (health, work, environment) to gain competitive advantage over the EU. That would only negatively affect the regular people. From the EU anthem: “Indeed, who even just has one soul to call his own in this world! And who never managed it should slink weeping from this union!” When the Cummings and Farages have no saying anymore, hopefully the UK will return. I strongly believe that is will be beneficial for the UK and the EU not just regarding trade. Greetings from Germany!
1	EU is a financial burden to UK
1	Congratulations, Britain! You made the right choice!
1	Im just glad it's over
0	Enjoy today before the inevitable recession hits. Proclaiming "project fear!" won't prevent it.
1	The chaos isn’t from leaving, it’s from people going behind everyone’s back and making sure we don’t leave
0	The EU has prevented inter European war.
0	The EU doesn't need most of what goes on in London as far as I can see.
1	Love how nationalist in USA are praising the UK for the Brexit.
1	The UK will be okay the rest will die or leave the EU USA run cartel.
1	Great Britain will be great Britain again woooooooohoooooo
1	Free to do what we want to do. Yippee
1	Congrats Britain! You’re sovereign again!
0	Maybe the problem is that Johnson knows how many committed Europhobes there are in his party, knows their history of being willing to damage their own party to get their way, and being a lazy sod with no concern for the wellbeing of others or the good of the country finds it easier to say things that will keep them backing him than have them turn on him.
0	Welcome Scotland ðŸ´ó §ó ¢ó ³ó £ó ´ó ¿ to the EU !
0	If Brexiteers want my support then give me a serious upside in the form of far reaching and progressive reform
0	It's a clusterfuck that just won't end, but no matter how they solve it, it's going to be jumping from a frying pan into the fire.
1	Collectivism is not the answer. Independence is.
1	The European Union is finally rid of british congenital mediocrity : goodbye, bums, and never come back !
1	We should have never joined the EEC/EU in the first place (in my view).
0	The lunatics have taken over the asylum. Some time in the future, which I won't see, we'll go crawling back and ask for remittance.
1	Im so glad we are finally out. The eu is a broken mess. It doesn't work never has never will time to reforge our paths.
0	See everyone in a few years when the UK economy is in the dumps and the Tories somehow find another way to blame the EU and liberals.
1	Congratulations! Well done! The sane anti globalist citizens of the United States support and stand by our staunch ally as it Brexits!
0	The most enthusiastic and ill-informed Brexiteers will suffer most by  Johnson’s hard line policies. They have been deluded and duped by  mendacious propaganda and they will show their disgust when Brexit fails  to live up their expectations, and fail it must and fail will.
1	British waters for British fishing communities ..simples..
0	Half of UK trade has been with EU and you are saying there's nothing to worry.
1	Over 50% of English/ British voted LEAVE. Including me. Great victory
0	This is a sad day. It won’t look different tomorrow. It won’t even feel different. But like any death, GriefnLoss will cloud the eye and simultaneously harden and tear our hearts. Never forget this was put into place by nefarious immoral n self interested politicians
1	Currently standing In Parliament Square, waiting for the celebrations to begin
1	Hail Britannia!
0	UK is suddenly looking like a banana republic
1	Brexit is a mistake for the EU who made poor decisions that ultimately lead to the UK's withdrawl from the EU and it's institutions. I'm confident that after a bumpy start the UK will do well and be a great success operating outside of the protectionist EU and it's institutions.
1	By demographics we are still part of Europe. But we simply don’t wish to be ruled by the EU. It’s so simple!
1	Put your citizen s first. God bless your road to recovery
1	That was the first good step, next get the Muslims out, and the UK will be beautiful.
1	An impressive opening salvo from Boris. Keep up the good speeches!
0	I think the protest is logical and your( i assume your from there) president is stupid
1	Start as you mean to go on, time to take control back from the EU, what is the point in leaving if they still tell us what they think should happen, the reality has not yet got through to Brussels we stopped being a member of your very expensive boys club on Friday last
1	lucky people.....this is what happens when you have leaders with such big balls as air ballons
1	Brexit should not be stopped.
0	The UK has a very good deal with the EU at the moment and if we vote to leave we will never be able to get back to this point should we decide to re-join in the future. I personally believe the EU provides more pros then cons.
1	Happy Brexit Day to my countrymen & women!
1	Leave.  You can't put a price on sovereignty.  Here is a documentary that makes the case for Brexit. It's about an hour long.
1	I think the EU oversteps it's bounds a lot. The benefits of membership are pretty fixed, but the drawbacks ratchet up year by year.
0	What the people want doesn't matter, much. You must move at the Elite's pace.
0	One couple didn’t bother voting at all because they never went abroad for their holidays so it was irrelevant to them whether the UK stayed in the EU or not.
1	European thuggery that’s all it is. Look back in history and see who they are WW1. WW2. Waterloo! Do I need to say more? They want our riches for nothing Go to Hell. Brexit was voted for and WILl succeed.
0	David Cameron played us. He was as arrogant as they come, gambling with our country, cut and ran when he lost.
0	Brexit was always going to be death by a thousand cuts. Not just the deceitful ones that come naturally to Boris and his cabinet, but by businesses pulling away from the UK, by talent - especially in the NHS - removing itself from the country for good, but the EU will stand firm as a massive trading block on behalf of its member states.
0	A store that has been making a loss since it was built - hence its closure.
1	Our Brexit destiny in the 21st Century is a watershed philosophical choice, far beyond immediate trade
1	My father, a proud dairy farmer, sold our farm back in the 80s. Due to the hated EU milk quota, it was cheaper to tip our milk away than get the tanker to pick it up. He joined the original Referendum party set up by James Goldsmith and we laughed at him because we thought it would never go anywhere. But look at us now Dad! Sadly, he didn't live to see us Leave but oh, how he would have LOVED today.! I am placing red, white and blue flowers on his grave later. Love you Dad xx
1	EU BASICALLY YOUR XXXXED GET YOUR BEGGING BOWL OUT !!!!! YOUR GUNNA NEED IT  🤣😃🤣😂🎉🇬🇧🇺🇸🇬🇧🍺
1	Possibly, but for the UK it will be worth it in the long run. The EU will suffer much more than the UK, which in effect means the European members, which, personally, I'm sorry for. We voted to do the best for the UK and unfortunately the rest of Europe has to live with it or do the same and get out of that corrupt, non electable bunch of cretans.
1	the Political Declaration does NOT stipulate that UK must adopt EU Regulations or EU Courts 😈.. or vice versa
0	We've done what Hitler, the Kaiser, Stalin and Napoleon couldn't do. Split the Country about an issue no one gave a monkeys about about for forty years.  And all so that I can get up at 5:00 to pick fruit and vegetables.
0	Dearest Scotland, PLEASE get out and vote in the EU referendum. You could well be the thing that saves this. Let's stay in xx
0	its so funny and nuts and crazy and stupid that some people really think the uk got the upper hand .funny times
1	thank god we're leaving, we're off.
1	England will be just fine
0	it seems like a massive screw-up from the politicians. You can blame the voters a bit too, but really, this should never have gone to a vote.
1	Onwards and upward. Remain is finished. Let’s make Britain Great again.
1	I'm a 22 year old Brit whose been sitting on the fence for a long time  but have recently decided I will be voting to leave. I'm a strong  believer in democracy and in my eyes the EU is entirely undemocratic. We  can vote for MEPs who can neither suggest new laws nor repeal existing  European laws. The real power in Europe lies in the hands of the  unelected. 10,000 of the bureaucrats at the EU earn more than our Prime  Minister. Whilst I believe there will be short term economic  repercussions of leaving, in the long run I hope to be better off.  Businesses like stability which is why I think so many support the  remain campaign. I don't believe these big multinational companies share  the interests of the common man though. A reading of this thread would  suggest that the youth vote is firmly with the remain campaign. Amongst  my friends (all recent graduates of different degrees from varying  social backgrounds) opinion is split. Overall I've been really  disappointed by the lack of impartial information on the referendum. It  seems to me that neither side has any idea what will really happen if we  leave!
0	Half the population did not vote for this. 37% of the electorate voted for Leave, without agreeing on what Leave actually meant. This is not at all the same thing.
1	Good for you Brits! Another strike against the globalist mob trying to dictate how you run your country as they rob you blind. Next beer is in your honor. 🍻
0	Simple. Do what we did before we joined the EU. What do you think we should spend the extra £165 million a week on that we will have when we leave?
1	I'm so happy we have left the European Union
1	Switzerland is fine and it never joined the EU
1	Omg how exciting. Britain taking back its country. An historical moment and I'm excited to be part of it. X
0	A civil war without brains" We don't have a culture war. We have whingers.
0	I love the nationalistic hypocrisy that’s rolling up here. The former Great Britain was great because of its colonies and everything that scavenge from there. If leaving EU is the next big thing in their agenda that will only bring isolation and provocation to the rest of the world to apply “special regime” for British nationals.
1	It's like leaving a bad marriage you happy it's all over!
1	Leaving the EU is the best thing that has happened to the UK for years and also had the benefit of clearing out the deadwood from Parliament.
0	We are heartbroken and still love EU <3 <3 <3 ~ they can take us out of Europe but they can't take Europe out of us ~ millions of us in the UK English, Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Irish remain #Remain. Now the work begins to #Rejoin.
1	So enamoured by Brexit they're willing to go to Downing Street to watch it happen on a big clock. Not able to list a single fucking benefit it'll have on our lives
1	Finally, the brits finally agree on something
1	What has Dave got lined up next - invite Angela Merkel over to say she will invade us if we #VoteLeave?
0	UK will fall hard
1	Looking at the wonderful cross section of cultures, ages and skin colours in Parliament Square HAHAHAHAHA ONLY KIDDING IT'S LIKE AN EXPLOSION IN A WHITE FOOL FACTORY #BrexitDay #BrexitCelebration
1	I feel good for UK leave and clean up their government.
0	How will closing Britain off be more prosperous economically?
1	I was in favour of EU reform, but it became clear with Cameron’s failed attempts that the EU would never reform. It is a fanatical, extremist project that is in total denial that it is failing. I therefore voted leave.
0	We’re alienating all of our closest trading partners, which is an  extremely poor economic decision. The creation of a hard border in  Northern Ireland could cause a resurgence of violence, but at the same  time internal borders within the country are a bad idea as it would  likely lead to the break up of the union, and if you have noticed how  much of a shitshow Brexit has been for our economy so far imagine what  Scotland leaving the UK would be like. Not to mention how shit this will  be for businesses in Gibraltar. Free trade is a beneficial thing for  everyone economically. I might decide I want to live and work abroad  later in life, brexit would make this difficult. Skilled workers from  the EU are very helpful to the economy and the NHS. The UK can no longer  be a base for companies wishing to access European markets easily,  which could cause them to relocate causing unemployment. The EU has an  incentive to make this a disastrous decision for the UK to set an  example to other member states considering leaving. In order to keep  business we may have to ditch the higher European standards and accept  lower standards of products from places like the USA, which could be bad  for the health and quality of life of the general population as well as  the environment. Also the Trump has said that the NHS would be on the  table for a trade deal, which if agreed to by our politicians, who  aren’t very well trusted at the moment could lead to the devaluation of  healthcare as a basic human right. But hey at least we get blue  passports.
1	I expect an explosion of prosperity in line with the Boris views.
0	No think tank is independent Most are funded directly from the government in ‘job inquiries’
1	Finally their out of there
1	I live in a 'Labour heartland' and I can tell you that the main reason for leaving Labour is immigration. Blair opened the doors and changed communities. People are open but too many came at once.
0	Can the BBC manage to shut up now on brexit and find some other drivel to inflate out of proportion?
0	As an Irishman I’m really sad that the UK is leaving. Best wishes and you’re always welcome back.
0	The economy started tanking years ago due the Brexit vote you clown.
1	Fantastic speech, being proud to be British is becoming fashionable again.
0	Brexiters are so stupid. Waiting over 3 years for something that's not happening! Politicians laugh at you, europeans and the rest of the world laugh at you lol
1	Considering how “toxic” the EU were and how much they held against us I’m surprised people aren’t happy with leaving.  Even if they wanted to stay in the EU, I feel they shown enough of their real intent to put people off staying in.  But that’s not happened and to those of you who still want to be in  the EU, after all that was said what kept you motivated to Remain?
0	No plan, 27 vs 1, what a joke brexit is.
0	It's the other way around too. A mate of me is from UK and spent all his adult life in EU. So uncertain too what will happen now
1	But what about democracy. There has already been a vote. But if the people who voted no get in power they just tell the people who won to piss off? That’s how you get civil unrest.
0	It's a economic bad decision
0	UK leaves the most wealthy club on the globe to keep the lowest life of standard.I hope that I am wrong
1	It's a beautiful thing.
0	Just remember uk fandom, we are and always will be Children of the EU-niverse. Fuck Br*xit. #BrexitDay
1	A year ago I might have said stay in the EU. But because Sturgeon wants us to stay in (greed!) I will now vote to leave
0	Today is a real tragedy for the nation. I so sincerely hope they suffer as much as the rest of the less affluent population is going to suffer in the fallout after they have manipulated them for their own political ambition. Alas, I fear they won't give a damn because they have so much money in the bank they would not know what hardship feels like. You are too polite in calling them despicable :-).
0	Brexit.... the gift that keeps on giving FFS
1	Looks like Boris got Brexit done to me... perhaps all those people decrying his promises on the hustings should come in the comments section here and admit they didn’t have a clue.
1	They sang a Scottish song on purpose. This institution is not a friend to the wider UK or any other country that goes against it.
1	I don't mind brexit. If they wanted to leave they could.
0	Membership can in no way be said to have damaged us. In fact, we would have become a vassel state of the USA in everything but name, had we tried to exist on our own. Even now, Boris has warned that we would have to obey any call from Trump to deploy troops abroad should he “request” it, so “sovereignty” is, as it has been for decades, a myth and an impossibility for a small, strategically positioned island in a world of global superpowers.
1	It certainly was not when we were in the corrupt eu.
1	Congrats to the people of the UK, and a happy Independence Day!
1	The land of hope and glory. Sing it everywhere. I am proud to be British.
0	Brexit day means nothing except that the people who orchestrated this scam can now line their pockets whilst they negotiate trade deals outside EU. Let's celebrate!
0	As a UK resident I find Brexit insane...people were not informed properly and we all need a second chance #votestay#voteagain
0	Such a pathetic situation... when the drama ends and the dust clears we will see who's who, true identities will be revealed :D and yes UK will rejoin in one form or another IF there is still a European Union... after UK realises they cannot survive alone... so sad... it's just a lot of time that needs to pass, some things take time. The effects will be definitely detrimental for all of us.
0	In what way did the EU restrict you exactly? By all measures it gave the UK citizens far more freedom.
0	You and your friends and family, including any children, personally, can travel, live, study, work or retire anywhere.
1	Make the EU pay Boris - the way they treated our country deserves punishment .
1	Britain is the first domino. In a few years there won't even BE an EU.
1	If remain win, it's will be the saddest day in UK's history!!!!!!!
1	The British have chosen liberty with Brexit and can congratulate themselves every day.
1	A well written piece, correct to highlight the risks of those in the EU who would seek to expand the federalist EU, the federalists have been too loud for too long in Europe, and its no wonder that for some the vote to leave the EU was a vote to leave an administrative body, to lose a layer of politics that felt excessive. If the option at some point in the future is for this to be an economic union, not a political, judicial, military and social union, then the UK should be seeking a return....
1	Glad we are leaving as most of Britain is
1	I voted Leave. I don’t want the country my family died fighting for to be controlled by the countries that surrendered or tried to occupy us. If you want further European cooperation then I’m open to it, but under British dominance and not German. Nothing the EU provides could not also happen without the EU and with simple agreements between nations. It is a trade protection bloc, nothing more.
1	Well done Brexitparty. Without you we would be stuffed.
0	One day they'll write in the history books about how the Tories led the UK to vote away their workers rights, environmental protections and to privatise the very health service that has helped every one of us and was once a great example to the rest of the world for how to run a health service for the people.
1	Independence day! Brexit Day! We are free from the shackles, ready to rule the world
1	I raise my glass brilliant... lets put the "Great" back into Britain onward and forward.. from now on..
0	Can't wait for all the old people who voted for this to watch their pensions and social programs get slowly eviscerated, and blame the youth for their political ineptitude.
1	Good. Best decision the country has made while I've been alive.
0	I'm pissed off because Scotland my country voted to stay
1	Bye merkel, tusk, macron, bye bye 😃
1	WE ARE HAPPY TO KEEP THEM SHUT THANKS , FREEDOM FOR US
1	If the majority of you is against Brexit, I'm sorry but you just didn't show up when it counted. 56 % of British electors voted for opposition to Johnson -- sure, but many of those vote for Labour, and many of the Labout voters are pro-Brexit.
0	In the UK and the US .... Putin's Plan is Working Fine.Just Fine!
1	I am attached to a strict approach to Brexit: I respect the British vote, but the worst thing would be a sort of weak E.U. vis-a-vis the British.
1	The UK must leave NATO next.
1	Congratulations Britain, as an American I personally wish you people the best of luck!
1	Lol , very negative outlook you have , but your very wrong , we'll continue trading with EU and now trade with rest of world in that time line you mentioned , we'll begin drilling oil from sea near Falklands Islands , massive reserves , look it up , be in control of are own laws and seas and border's , UK will go from strength to strength , no more bailing out failing countries that belong in the EU , UK fifth biggest economy will withstand
0	History will record Cameron's submission of Brexit to the popular vote as the dumbest decision by any British PM since Chamberlain's appeasement  of Hitler by handing over Czechoslovakia.
1	Stop giving the eu money , that should do it , scrap the HOP and create a BREXIT govt
1	I absolutely adore him. There’s a really optimistic buzz in The City that has been absent for over ten years.
1	Those willing to give up freedom for security deserve neither.
0	Please Britain you haven't got an empire anymore, Britain is a weak country now, Spain and Portugal used to have huge empires and only got influence in the world due to the EU.
0	Why would someone want the EU to fail? There are so many separate countries in Europe that it's easy to spark a war if there is no unity.
0	I am 17 years old, I am a student and currently study politics. Last night a decision was made which will have a direct impact on my future. The decision to leave the EU was made without my voice being heard. I couldn’t vote in what is probably the most important political decision the British people have made, an irreversible decision. I have followed these campaigns, I am capable of making an informed and rational choice – the fact that I wasn’t able to, that many other informed and passionate 16/17-year-olds were not able to, seems to me incredibly undemocratic.  My future is completely changed; I will not have the benefits my parents and their generation have had, such as freedom of movement between all EU countries. Mostly I am outraged that this decision, which reflects on the British people, has been made without my consent. The future already looks less bright for us and it is a future I did not have a say in shaping.
0	Brexit is stupider than the electoral college system
1	It's not EU that has kept the peace in Europe, it is NATO:  @LouiseBoursUKIP. @bbcquestiontime  Well said.
1	The Lords’(heavily pro-Remain) #EU Financial Affairs Sub-Committee concluded that“Article 50 allows the #UK to leave the EU without being liable for outstanding financial obligations under the EU budget”. That’s £39 Billion Saved.#Brexit #NoDeal #ProBrexit #HardBrexit #Leave
1	Btw congratz England on brexit,  and you old timers we are still European, we have a strong bond and nothing will change that, we Norwegians are just happy you got control of your country back
0	Johnson proving once again that brexit is a concept that can't be delivered.
1	Well done Boris!
0	Brexit was a fantastic example of a nation shooting itself full in the face.
0	As a teenager (who is going to have to deal with the consequences of Brexit but not knowing a thing about what is happening) this video was extremely helpful
1	The biggest problem with most of the MP's, they do not know how the EU operate and what their rules say with regard to any country leaving. The EU cannot negotiate with a member country while still in the EU. Therefore we the UK have to be outside the EU before they will negotiate with the UK. The only way we can have meaningful negotiations with the EU is to leave on WTO conditions or at least indicate we are prepared to do so on the 29th March 2019. All the nonsense spoken by Barry Gardener re -poverty and homelessness etc has nothing to do with the UK leaving the EU as they are all internal issues to the UK. The only way for the Labour manifesto to get any traction we have to leave on WTO terms. Caroline Lucas advocated that the vast majority of young voters were for remain -- various studies have shown that when asked most young voters were indoctrinated by their College/ Uni. lecturers in EU propaganda and actively discouraged from finding out about the leave campaign.
0	Brexit must be halted in its entirety by all means necessary.
1	I am happy for you, you have finally managed to drop the chains of the EU. I only wish you the best for the future. Down with the EU dictatorship.
0	It can be undone, but people need the stomach for it - determination is required.
0	How long to implement the change will be my biggest concern!!
0	There are uncountable benefits of being in the EU. One is the unprecedented level afforded by the freedom of movement rules for EU citizens, which over a million Brits are benefiting from right now.
1	Just set fire  to my EU flag
0	Brexit is and will continue to be lies and fantasy nonsense, blaming the EU and remainers and taking no responsibility whatsoever. Johnson is playing to the domestic gallery, relying on the stupidity of many of his supporters and believe you me, many of them haven't a clue. This was predictable.
1	The EU have learned nothing from Brexit but our future is bright
1	We're not isolated from the world. The world knocks on our door.
1	The EU needs The United Kingdom of Great Britain & Northern Ireland because they know we are the best country in the world. We are & will always be part of Europe & can defend the continent & don't need the EU
1	Well done Britain, leading the way for other European nations to follow
1	British problems can b addressed by the British people via their elected British government. No the filthy EU.
0	UK don't understand what they are asking for.
1	Brexit the Great decision ever.... :)
1	I give the EU 5 years tops. How long can two or three Countries bankroll 24 others?
1	TO BOLDLY GO, WHERE ANYONE COULD GO BEFORE!
1	I’ve arrived in Westminster and this guy isn’t in a magnanimous mood
0	As someone from OS , the problem is not the EU, it's the laws and set up in this country that essentially discriminates against and fails to protect the lower classes. Simple stuff like being forced to pay the real estate fees and land rates for rental properties, elsewhere the landlord pays for that, it's their property. Pay day loans with extortionate rates, elsewhere these are illegal. Road taxes are high, insurance costs are high; people need a car to work but can't afford to have a car. Fix the basics and empower the poor and the country prospers...but I'm guessing the upper classes wouldn't like that???
0	EU must not open yet another exception for the UK. Enough is enough.
0	REMEMBER UK IMPORTS 50% OF ITS FOOD MAINLY FROM EU  At #Brexit referendum day  £1 bought 1.43€. worth of food   Today £1 buys 1.1745€ worth of food.   A weak currency is a sign of problems in an economy.   AND WHO PAYS FOR FARAGE AND JOHNSON'S   MEGALOMANIA ?   THE HOUSEHOLDER
0	Hitler comes nowhere when it comes to crazy barking-mad imagery while making speeches.
0	Don't worry UK. Thatchers government won't sell out the North's car industry, Wales air industry and the fishermen to save the city bankers. O no wait, yes they will
0	ONE WORD "BYE"
1	The EU realised that we have escaped and are now desperately trying to handcuff us again. We are their prized pet or treasure island as we have become known in Brussels. Boris is having none of it.
0	This reflects the total failure of the UK to correctly prioritize education and training.
1	"I've just never been prouder of my country... Brexit day is about celebrating not just Brexit it's about celebrating democracy. It's alive and well and kicking in Britain."
1	God bless Brexit, PM Boris Johnson and HM The Queen
0	The EU market comprises 440mn consumers.  The UK market has just 65mn.   The EU  market is six times larger than the UK market. The EU accounts for 47% of UK exports.   If we want access to that market we will have to agree to align to EU standards.  Take your pick.
0	The longer this goes on the more the ridiculous this senseless brexit actually is after 40 years of economic unity
0	Whoever voted to leave just know you're stupid
0	Forget the markets. London will plunge into a deep recession if brexit passes, it will be worse than the one that hits the countryside.
1	The EU are pathetic.   Full of threats and bullying tactics. Nice people.  They don't learn.   They clearly want a hard Brexit.
1	Merkel is a traitor and all the Germans and Europeans alike want her hanged for crimes against humanity.
1	Lol Jk Rowlings yeah right she worried about her money! People r been foolish was best choice to leave as time will tell
0	Oh yeah, just what the UK needs, US-style health insurance with its high rates.
0	You could have invested in the NHS and schools anytime you wanted, and you cut police numbers,
0	I think it's dumb.
0	It does not feel thought trough
1	On your way out, can I invite you to peek at my book, "Slaying Brexit Unicorns"? It busts two dozen Brexit myths
1	But the EU remains a conglomeration of vastly differing countries in size, language, culture, economy and a hundred other things. It can never be moulded into a single state.
1	Well done England! YOU ARE FREE !!! Congratulations !!! Now my Poland must leave the German union! Long live free England! Long live Poland!
1	I think our stance on Brexit has perhaps been one of the most powerful things in helping people to recognise the values of the Liberal Democrats.
1	Only two more days and we regain our independence.  Brilliant!!!
0	if you are rich & can move assets it's bonanza time. The other 99% of the population are screwed
1	Let the  mass European Exodus from tyranny begin
1	The EU wetting their pants as we speak. That UK tail is seriously going to wag the dog when it comes to talking trade with the EU. It's going to be UK rules or no rules. Onward Brittania!
0	UK leaves the most wealthy club on the globe to keep the lowest life of standard.I hope that I am wrong
1	LEAVE!
1	if true, the Remain campaign are using dirty tricks to coerce you to stay. http://telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/eureferendum/12186850/Exclusive-David-Cameron-aide-complained-about-John-Longworth-to-British-Chambers-of-Commerce-hours-before-he-was-suspended.html #shame #brexit #eureferendum #gogogo
0	I'm ready to get off Brexit. Greatest mistake.
1	The U.K. is just the first nation to leave the E.U.,  they will not be the last.  The E.U. is on the verge of imploding and only fools deny it
0	The UK wants to have the butter and the money of the butter and the cow. It's not possible. The UK  must know that the EU it's not only a market.
0	From having control of our borders To not having control of our borders #Madness Need a #PeoplesVote And prosecution to #Brexiteers who lied, misled and damaged our nation.
0	There are so many similarities between Brexitors & Trump voters.  Their anger can not be extinguished even when they get what they want.
1	Only took 4 years coz of snivelling remainers obstructing democracy
0	Imagine if they atcually focused this energy on helping the poorest in the country instead of backing politicians who think they're a great
1	CONGRATULATIONS BRITS! Great to hear you're getting your country back and no longer subjected to the silly laws and restrictions from the out of touch EU leaders.
0	How's Brexit going to help them? If anything it's going to make them poorer.
0	Poor misguided souls. By the time they realise the extent of the damage they have caused, it will be too late. Britain will be the Poor Man of Europe once again.
1	We support Brexit but that does not make us bad guys
0	The Brits like us Americans are fast becoming a new generation of fascists. I hope the EU will be able to withstand this rising tide of hate and self destruction.
1	Brexit is so important, it would have been neglect of duty to simply sit it out.
1	Brexit is giving the EU's remaining members a good reason to stick together
1	congratulations UK and well done i just wish Ireland had the balls to do the same
0	Thanks to brexiteers now we will be paying more for medicine Someone has to pay for whats coming.
1	“End of the world” according to remoaners!.
0	Stay stay stay!
1	Finally, all countries should leave the EU
1	The is going to be a punch up with the eu sooner or later ! So when the media tries to scare you with anti Boris/Brexit propaganda (again) just remember no matter what they say, our Island will prevail and tough times ahead are a small price to pay for securing freedom for our children. (not long ago the same price had to be paid for with rivers of blood , we were lucky it only cost us a vote).
1	We are so happy that the Will of the British People prevailed and Brexit was done!!
0	Look at the demographic in the 'leave' crowd. I don't know what's whiter.
1	Doesnt matter how you look at it,a no deal scenario is the best deal by far. Only then can we square up to the EU with a very good case for a free trade deal that is at least fair to the UK.
1	"We are much more than a star on somebody else's flag" .... think that pretty much sums it all up really. 👍
0	t's interesting to see all those brave Brexiteers frothing at the mouth....
1	Today is the UK's last day of being in EU.Our time has come
1	Really looking forward to the EU crashing and burning when they can't cope without the UK's cash.
1	WTO Australia style is fine for UK
0	brexit is shit travelling gets harder
0	Germany won. Britain is lost some fools even reminded ''rule Britania'' while no more colonies to exploit, no natural resources or big industries. Its byebye little Britian.
0	I worry about the direction of the U.K. and U.K. politics and governance in the event of a Brexit.
1	It's good we've gone, but we'll never know the good deal we could already have concluded if it hadn't been for all the remainiac traitors working on behalf of the EU al this time - [and I am including Theresa May in that]  - one of the might have beens of history.
0	The British betrayed the European Union
1	Although I am glad about us leaving the EU on Jan 31st 2020, am over the moon with the non alignment with EU after us leaving, also with trade talks coming to an end at the end of the year, I am not happy as an ex serviceman with the government allowing Cobham to asset stripped.
0	The UK will now need to negotiate many dozens of trade-deals in fairly short order. How many well-experienced and competent trade negotiators does the UK have? Not many, I suggest, since the UK has not negotiated any for decades - the experts in the EU did the negotiations. Good Luck!
1	all you need to know is that the UK will be a better place to do anything and everything because the Brussels bureaucracy will no longer hold sway in this country . Amen .
0	The far right MSM (Mail, Sun, Express and Telegraph) are, were and will continue to be complicit. They are owned by billionaires who have little or no interest in what's best for the British people. They only care about themselves!
1	Thank you Jesus for Brexit. UK is a great nation. Together, in unity we will unleash its potential. No longer will one man in Brussels decide our destiny and carve our paths for us. Arise UK for your light has shone. God is for you.
0	The future of the Brexiteers: Daddy , all the foreigners are gone why haven't you got a job
0	It is a weakest decision Britain had done so far.
0	urge everyone that wants to stay in the EU to go and vote on the 23rd! Every vote counts! Think about the future!
0	Brexiters make me laugh...They want a good deal for them, ( UK deals) but no to respect  the EU deals and ageements. Morons.
0	The grounded planes, the chaos in the streets, the unpaid workers, the crippling strikes,
0	I hope the worst of the business failures & job losses happen in the Brexiteer areas. They voted Brexit, they should get to feel the consequences of their actions
0	Michel Barnier has warned that UK goods entering the EU will be subject to border checks,
1	Between the union and the eu. I choose the union. Not both!! 2nd ref... no change for me. Maybe it's cause the Indy ref only happened before the brexit vote.
1	Tell that Brussels house of Babel that you are no longer gonna sort the frogs from the fish. Same for schnitzel. And haggis if they're not careful.
1	And now conservative has won (Boris Johnson) and now we are leaving
1	Well done UK finally free of the EUSSR!
1	Don't be sheep and vote OUT.
1	End of cheap labour is good for everyone.
0	I live in Wales, we are more supported by the EU than by London. There's  really no contest about which way to vote if you're in Wales or NI.  Stay.  If leave hits then it's just going to be a matter of time before  Scotland leaves the UK and then it'll be time for Wales to campaign to  do so as well.  Also, not needing a visa to go visit Europe? That's just amazing, I wouldn't want to give that up for the world.  Edit: Inbox replies disabled. I've written a very abbreviated version  of what I think and feel with generalisations with this message and I  don't want to get drawn into a debate or a discussion.
0	If you think you live in a democracy ,you're deluded.However,I hope it all works out without any problems, I just doubt it.Ireland's troubles are likely to restart and Scotland is likely to separate from the UK ,which will spell the end of the United Kingdom and if that happens what's left could easily slip in to obscurity.I hope none of this happens but votes have consequences and when only 2 of the 4 Kingdoms want to do something this fundamental to the country ,forcing the other 2 Kingdoms to go along, unrest is likely to ensue.When the UK joined the EU all the Kingdoms wanted it with a 62% vote for it ,now a little better than 50% vote in 2 of the Kingdoms and that is the end of the UK being in the EU,a recipe for disaster.
0	A triumph of democracy? Hahaha ... today is a triumph for Britain's oligarchs and the entire elite in the UK who have managed to blame the EU for the public's feelings of discontent. With the help of the tabloids that these oligarchs own they have been able to brainwash the people into voting Brexit. Soon hundreds of thousands of jobs will be lost, prices in the shops will soar and worker's rights will be abolished. And these oligarchs will turn Britain into a low income low tax haven. The gullible and ill-informed British working man is the turkey that voted for Christmas. Flagwaving always works in the end.
0	Johnson is a charlatan and a liar. He wrecked our standing in the world when foreign secretary and now is trying to finish the job - a total disgrace.
0	All Brexit seems to be doing is making existing problems far worse whilst creating enormous new problems at the same time
1	Make Britain great again!
1	Millions of people can't be wrong. Unless they are british.
1	Yayyy finally we have left the EU dictatorship
0	And now conservative has won (Boris Johnson) and now we are leaving .... i think.
0	Can't wait for Scotland and Northern Ireland to secede and get their due independence from the UK. Next few years will be an absolute blast.
1	The EU was always about removing trade and industry from the British Isles, along with depleting our Armed forces. Now it is time to start rebuilding them back and make it that we import less from the EU. Past Governments have worked with the EU and now we need we need to reintroduce the a Treason act to stop that from taking place again.
1	The globalists tried to ignore the will of the people and undo a democratic vote but in the end the people won this round. The fight against globalism is far from over though
1	Congratulations! The sun is shining a little brighter, the birds are chirping a little louder and the smiles are a little broader.
0	Day 3 of Brexit. Pound tumbles. He’s heading us towards an Australian, otherwise known as a no deal Brexit next year.
1	Brexit has saved Britain from EU immigrant hell. Greece sends more riot police to Lesbos after immigrant riots.
0	this does not look like a good deal... considerably worse than being a member... i wonder if we got it wrong....
0	Stop it!
1	I voted for Brexit. I'm not die hard passionate about it. However I am very  anti globalist so I am pleased to decentralise unelected power.
1	OUT ,i find it an insult to be part of europe ,i am BRITISH NOT EUROPEAN
1	Congratulations to the UK! I hope that my country France will leave this fiasco that is the European Union. I wish you the best!
1	i was never asked if i wanted to be irrevocably bound by laws set by an unelected commission
0	What a sad, sad day. #NotMyBrexit #NotInMyName #LookAfterOurStar
0	This is not the end. it is the beginning of the end.
1	Interesting 'Values' the #EU is supporting, and let us not think that the construct is democratic, it is rules by #Berlin and #Paris, the rest are just spectators. #Brexit
1	It'll be a pleasure to take our custom elsewhere. UK imports from the EU were £357 billion (53% of all UK imports). Ouch!
1	I’m not british myself, but I do hope England (we shouldn’t make assumptions about the Scotts) leaves the EU. They are a constant source of imperialist arrogance and are an obstacle to greater integration. These are the people that are the forefathers of rampant capitalism, exploitation of workers, material and cultural collonialism, inventors of poor laws and work houses and who are more worried about corporate interests than the prosperity of citizens.
1	Wow, BBC totally cut Nigels speech so you didnâ€™t hear how reasonable and funny it was.
0	We'll end rejoining in 10-15 year's time and your legacy will subside into dust and you will become an irrelevance...enjoy the limelight whilst you still have it.
0	The sad thing is even when the economy has utterly collapsed a large section of the electorate will just blame it on "fake news" or some other rubbish. Just as they disbelieve in climate change, experts, and anything resembling reality.
1	EU is crumbling, get out now follow
0	I think I will move to Scotland and re-join EU. Let’s all do that!
0	Brexiteer snowflakes crying "now is the time to come together guys" after being complete cunts for 4 years is so funny. I wish them all the worst
1	Just a few hours to FREEDOM. The beginning of new 'Great' era. Let's all get behind our wonderful country! I humbly extend from Brexit hand out to all those remainers.
0	good luck, an Island needs trade and workers, I think some people must think that they have no idea they live on an island
0	BIGGEST mistake we will ever make, we are dependent on the EU to function, well done to all you jobsworth BREXITEERS who do not have a clue about politics, we need Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband to take over this mess and have Corbyn as travel secretary and finally the honourable Dianne Abbott as the secretary of state, she's brill.
1	Brexit is just the first domino to fall in what will eventually be the collapse of the EU. It was doomed from the start: too many members had nothing in common culturally or historically. For instance, most people in northern Europe see southern Europe as a place to go to play, not to do business and partner. Then there was Merkel's boneheaded decision to let immigrants in, no questions asked. Finally, there was the time-frame: people on both sides of the Pond believe that their governments have forgotten the citizens for whom they work. The cure for all three of those problems is to throw the b**tards out. Brexit is just the leading edge of what lies ahead. In the meantime, let us remember Maggie Thatcher's wise words from September 1986: "We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at a European level with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels. Certainly we want to see Europe more united and with a greater sense of common purpose. But it must be in a way which preserves the different traditions, parliamentary powers and sense of national pride in one’s own country; for these have been the source of Europe’s vitality through the centuries." I wish she were still with us. She and Reagan made a huge difference in the world. It is too-too bad--and sad--that there are no comparable leaders on the world scene today.
1	I feel so proud of my country.
0	UK leaves the most wealthy club on the globe to keep the lowest life of standard.I hope that I am wrong
0	By leaving UK will lose Scotland and NI, and many jobs. They think they are a colonial power, but they are not. We are in 2019, not in 1800..
1	I'm sure it will be fine in the end
0	We're all gonna die. Woohoo
0	Here is my 2020 to 2040 predictions; 1) Scotland will separate, regardless of what London wants. 2- Ireland will recover and do very well with EU trade. 3) Trump will lose and the new Admin will take a softer approach but the result is the same- parasitical capitalism enters the UK. The pound thinks its better off but will decrease in value. Leavers will enjoy learning how to clean their old and dying ,instead of the cheap labor,they deem to spit on.Also they will enjoy cleaning, washing dishes , picking fruit all day long and so on. After 10 yrs of this shitt - they will give up and plead to rejoin the EU -who will reject their pleas!
0	The time has come to sit back, and watch Brexit crash and burn.
0	If they wanted to leave EU that's ok but Brits should be greatful to be part of EU, without it they would be much much poorer now
0	Dear UK, Close your eyes and brace for economic impact...
1	Love the feeling of deciding our own future again. Its a great day...to all Brexiteers have a great evening. To all remainers...well let's hope it works out better than you think. You never know unless you try. Onward fellow Brits.
1	America: We elected Trump!  UK: Hold my beer...  Yes, I know the brexit vote was before the 2016
0	Today I have my identity as an #EUCitizen stolen by a bunch of rich, right-wing shysters and gullible idiots.
0	Ok, it's been 2 days and I still think #Brexit is rubbish.
0	Goodbye scotland. Goodbye NI.
1	we need to boycott the EU, so we can starve them out !
0	Pompous British think they are the center of the European universe. The EU can go to NYC for financial services, uh oh Brits looks like you going to be hoisted on your own petard.
0	As an American this is incredibly painful to watch...and I feel certain I can speak for large numbers of my fellow countrypersons when I say I am so, SO sorry you guys are having to go thru this.
0	Brexit is driven by people with nothing to lose. Those who are cripplingly poor and want change and those who are rich seeking to get richer. You don't need Paddy Power to work out the odds of who will really benefit.
1	Britain for the British 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
0	Brexit guaranteed to be a calamity
1	They did the right thing
0	An excellent piece by Stephen Bush in the New Statesman. On post Brexit business and companies betting against the UK economy. Perhaps an indicator as to the negative impact Brexit will have on the UK.
1	Fisheries must be controlled by Britain, I know the Dutch are worried about it, what they dont understand is that the British industry was one of the largest in the world, it has been decimated by the EU. We want it back at any expense
1	Cheers everybody. God Bless Great Britain !
1	Ask yourself this question: If it's so great being in the EU, Why would the EU be scared that other countries might follow suit?
1	Leave because sovereignty is important. The Euro is poisoning the whole  of the EU. Better to get out now than wait until the inevitable  disorderly break up. Open borders is not a good idea either,  particularly with countries much poorer than yourself and who are locked  in an austerity death spiral.
0	The main problem is this: Brexit has seriously compromised the UK's ability to influence its future. It no longer has a seat in the political organization setting the economic rules all its neighbours (and about 50% of its own trade) abide by. It has destroyed whatever goodwill it has left among these neighbours (public and political), mostly because of ill thought out rhetoric by its political leaders. It is now isolated and vulnerable in a world dominated by huge trade blocs.
1	It's good,because England has saved 2nd world war 2 the European countries.The kingdom must act her ownself her political kingdom identity except economy cooperation with Europeans.
1	If you couldn't make it to Parliament Square tonight and you're gutted to be missing out on the atmosphere, here you go. #brexitnight #BrexitCelebration
0	It must be painful for the BBC to admit.
0	Brexit will make every one poorer
0	I’m surprised that Bonehead Johnson has decried “Mumbo-Jumbo”. He displayed a particular skill in that respect during the Brexit campaign
1	The reality is that the majority of Britain(or rather England and Wales) never had much respect for Europe anyway, we look down on the continent and their culture, the laid back attitudes we see in Spain, France, Belgium etc we laugh at them. I have spoken to many people, young people included about the economies of Europe and how we should become more like them, they have said that we should follow the examples of America and Asia as they are bigger and therefore "more successful" economies. We as a nation have turned our noses up at Europe because they don't have quite the rapid economic growth that China and South Korea have. It seems that everything in Britain has to be about economic growth, I for one do not think we deserve to be in a union with Europe if we fail to respect the attitudes European nations take towards the economy putting their people above business. If we don't want to be like Europe why should we be allowed to be in it?
0	England now has only 3 vowels left : A I O They officially have left E U
1	those filthy EUers wanting to make deals, giving 'good' advices.. haha, fools without arguments, I hope every country will get out of it
0	Sad day but I'm honestly done with politics. Between the clownshow that is Trump in America and Brexit it's too toxic and not worth the mental strain it puts on our lives. I'll keep up with key policy changes but there's no point following this circus day to day.
1	Good. France should leave the EU as well.
1	Oh dear EU it seems companies are more likely to desert the EU than Britain.
1	The EU are utterly undemocratic and run by a dictatorial "bunker"  mentatilty that refuses to countenance reform or a change of mindless  ambition.  And, should you dare to disagree, then (except for France of course) you will be punished.  The EU will do everything it can to punish the UK for leaving, and to dissuade others from following this path.  Mean-spirited Dinosaurs the lot of em.
1	Regrettably leave. It started as the European Coal and Steel Community  shortly after WW2 - which obviously, due to it's name - had a focus that  was clear and concise with only 6 founding members. It is now just a  great big mess consisting of far too many countries with far too many  different agendas.
1	If the EU is so successful why is it so afraid of competition? The EU has suffocated creativity and innovation in Europe and wants to ensure that we are trapped in their sphere of decline. Not one of the world's top 20 tech companies is European - even the Israelis are far ahead of European on tech development. Boris must ensure that we leave the EU graveyard and are free to rejoin the world of the living.
1	47 years of EU membership is finally ending. In 1973 we joined what we were told was a free trade area only. We then had an EU superstate and successive EU treaties forced on us where the EU seized control of all parts of the UK. Brits had enough with the lies and voted for Brexit.  However, the Remtards are still trying to convince us the EU is the best thing since sliced bread.
1	THIS IS IT, Freedom day from the EU. As said sometime back, we may have lost some battles Brexiteers, but we WOULD win the War. We can thank the despicable remoaner MPs with their obvious hate for Britain and Democracy that made Brexit most likely. The future is ours now
0	Brexit is stupid idea ..waste of time .until now no one give a clear idea what is going on .
0	Bye bye, don’t let the door hit you
1	The EU belongs to FIFA, and FIFA is a corrupt organisation.
1	Lets build a wall and make the EU pay for it.
1	Be a Churchill Mr. Johnson don't be a Chamberlain..No retreat, no surrender and no backing down to the EU dictatorship!
1	Make English Great Again!!!
1	Hopefully the license fee will be next and you liars and propagandists can go and earn your keep for once.
1	You probably voted no in the first place, I don't think you want anything to work.
1	Civil servant leading Brexit preparations at NI Dept of Econ says the substance of the ‘unfettered access’ NI-GB promise remain
0	Leaving the EU would actually cause economic problems for theEU an UK, but the UK's problems would last longer and be worse
1	With you all the way
1	Just the sight of that EU flag makes me feel nauseous.
1	Best to vote to leave Britain was a Superpower once remember
1	Wittering on about how you hate Leave voters will not encourage them to listen to you.
1	They did it. I am definitely skeptical of the European Union so I'm not shedding a tear. I don't agree with how they are doing it but that's their business. People who were opposed to Brexit have nobody to blame but the opposition. The complete inability of opposition parties to unify instead of political grandstanding was hilarious. This decision was made by Labour, the Lib-Dems, and SNP as much as it was made by the Tories.
0	Brexit latest DOWNSIDES Job losses Businesses gone End of manufacturing Workers/environmental rights gone Chlorinated
0	The fact that pro-Brexit commenters on here call this very fair, balanced video "fear mongering" shows how deranged the Brexiters are
1	So it looks like the 4-day 1st war of Brexit is officially over: Brexiters got all excited on Brexit day as Guernsey ban
1	I still believe brexit was the right choice, it's just I have no confidence of it ever being delivered. Nobody I know voted for more free trade and more immigration but that's what we're getting.
1	We didn't loose Europe , we fought tooth and nail to get out
1	Life and business would go on outside the EU. No point living if fear and clinging to the EU come what may. Let's give it a go.
0	Indeed the main trait of Bojo’s personality is laziness so he had two options here:(1) work a lot for a deal that will not satisfy everybody in the Brexiter side...alienating some people from supporting him and his party. (2) or do nothing then blame the EU ( easy ) and satisfy and expand his political base...
0	Boris doesn't have the competence to be PM for long. Brexit is a disaster, and the UK economy will be damaged for years afterwards.
1	congratulations England for Brexit, well done Johnson:)
1	Is the border between Gibraltar and Spain a potential problem. Gib will soon be free of the EU. How about Cyprus? EU Greek Cyprus and the Turkish occupied north. Border crossing is not a problem. How about the Isle of Man and Channel Islands? Both part of the British Isles, but not members of the EU. The EU is just looking for problems. The Irish border is a matter for the UK & Ireland, not Brussels/Berlin.
0	Britain will regret for leaving the European Union. After 2 years there will be lots of crisis in Britain. Congratulations Britain.
1	Just to show there are no hard feelings I am celebrating leaving the EU with a Belgian beer :-)
1	So far, the only positive effect I've read about often of the EU has been the reduction of mobile roaming charges. Whoopee-do.
0	I can't shake the feeling that a referendum was the worst way to do this
1	This guy has a sense to make the Britain again
0	Oooh controversial! I’m not a fan of brexit, I feel that the original referendum came at a time when the public were very disenfranchised with the political system and the outcome din’t necessarily reflect the true beliefs of the country but more the want for change in the system. Plus the referendum has so many issues with the campaigns on both sides and whether it was binding. What really annoys me though is that research in universities has already been really affected by this and all the unknowns that go with it. With all the things we might struggle with after the big day, it seems very short sighted to do this without a good plan or something that resembles a deal
1	Why would anyone want to join the EU? If the EU turned into a simple trade union, instead being a controlling government over sovereign governments, then it would be so much better. Until then, cheers to the UK from the US of A!!
0	You’ve just insulted a whole load of your customers. I very much doubt all them were Remainers
0	Pity you weren't there when a million of us marched to stop this madness. A minority of the electorate voted for pro Brexit parties in the general election. Opinion polls confirm majority is still anti Brexit. We are leaving without popular consent.
1	Wish us luck when you wave us goodbye....sorry the rest of you need luck. We will be ok on our own.
1	Yes! I'm very excited to take out country back! How any of you remainers are happy to be controlled by Germany is beyond me. You have short memories and seem to have forgotten what Germany's aggression did to our country over 2 world wars and the amount of death and suffering they caused. Even though Germany lost two world wars, they have somehow managed to take control of Europe anyway! It's just that they've done it in a smarter and more civilised way in 2020 than in 1914 and and 1939. Germany have been the ones pushing for a huge divorce bill, yet everyone seems to forget the billions that Germany still owe us in war reparations, that they will never pay back! Yet we owe them money?? My grandfathers both fought in ww2 for my freedom, and I'm over the moon that today is the day that their suffering and sacrifice is no longer in vain! Today is a good day!
0	it has been kind of exhilarating to watch Britain partly realizing how incredibly dangerous and detrimental Brexit is going to be
0	brexit over for another year, the drama will return in december, keep watching brexit is a never ending story, and uncertinity
0	If they wanted to leave EU that's ok but Brits should be greatful to be part of EU, without it they would be much much poorer now
0	What a disaster, no winners here now.
1	Many Dutch people envy the Uk right now.
0	Our great leader, the inveterate lier, adulterer, philanderer, Johnson is going to lead the country to greatness...what a hope, more like leading us into complete disaster.
0	we won't be gone long
1	Finally standing up to the EU! Long overdue.
0	Let's face it, we have a PM who is either grossly incompetent or just doesn't give a toss about the damage he's inflicting on our country. I suspect it's both!
0	Brexit is another worrisome sign of the European drift towards right-wing ideologies spread by demagogues taking advantage of the bad economic situation of many.
0	Dear England,  Thanks for fucking us all in the ass, you racist cunts.  Love Scotland
0	Still can’t believe Brexit is actually happening, and that the people of the UK willed it to be.
1	Happy Brexit day  Democracy prevailed  Remainners you LOST!!
1	I was Leave then and I’m leave now VOTE LEAVE 🇬🇧
0	The EU is even helping Britain to stop Russia to protect British people from nerve agent attack. This is the truth.
1	So fucking awesome. Fuck the EU and it's endless shitty regulations.
1	I know that we can turn this opportunity into a stunning success.
0	The Brexiters and their politicians are the worse people in the UK. Scum floats to the top.
1	It seems clear to me that politicians and technocrats are moving towards bigger unity within the continent but the project is quite flawed for the very specific reason that we live in a continent with over 30 countries, each with their own culture, history and... economies.
1	We’re no longer leavers or remainers, we’re now optimists or pessimists
0	There will also be a simultaneous economic fallout to cope with
1	We hold the cards despite what the remainers keep telling you.
1	Feel sorry for remainers leaving the EU last Friday, then finding all your fears were just a load of project fear lies. Just joking the first line.
0	No-one will notice anything different. It was all a complete waste of time and money.
1	Another example of the British press delivering poor quality, irresponsible reporting to the easily influenced (to simple to conduct their own analysis) by the Daily Express.
0	So, have fun being a vassal of the U.S.
0	HOW I WISH THE VOTE TO LEAVE THE EU NEVER HAPPENED!!
1	Good. Best decision the country has made while I've been alive.
0	Leaving the EU is a very sad decision that will do huge damage to Britain’s prosperity & Europe’s stability.
1	a lot of things I have already agreed to do this year, not least the work I do for Alzheimer’s Research UK, so I thought it was important that I carried on with that work
0	[Don't Do It](https://i.imgur.com/18BwYOI.jpg)
1	Wow I feel like a new woman...so glad we waited four years for this
0	Uk should remain in EU
0	Such an idiota. You can know officially be an US colony. Enjoy.
1	Remoaners, why are you still here? Go emigrate. Don't let the door hit you on the way out.
1	The EU, when looking for new trade deals will no longer be able to pi#p the UK market around the world to tempt customers.
0	Apart from the likelihood of being stabbed, tripping over a homeless, no access to quick healthcare, shite transport links and a housing market no-one can join from the bottom.
1	We are finally Free! Free at last!
0	WW3 in 10 years, see you then lol.
1	I will vote leave. True, our economy will suffer in the short term, but the EU has been wallowing in deep economic trouble for a while now, and it still has not recovered. I honestly could not care less about immigration.
0	For those Brexiteers complaining about the EU, please don’t forget that you voted for this so please stop moaning about a situation you helped create.
0	I am from Romania and I met an amazing british guy in a hotel that decided to visit every single country in the EU because he feared missing this opportunity due to the stupid brexit.
1	Great to know you’re on our side Boris, keep strong.
1	Boris would be very wise to stick to his promise to UK fisherman. I'm tired people who claim it's an insignificant industry, it certainly wasn't before we gave our waters away. It's time for us to make a stand. Our hard working fishermen have been sold down the river for decades, and I have no doubt if he backs down there's plenty who will want 'to know the reason why'- as they say in Cornwall. And to you fishermen in Scotland, keep a very close eye on a certain woman who will happy shaft you ....
0	Many Remainers accept the advice in this article and easily see the opportunities afforded to the UK by leaving the EU.   But we also know that the UK is not prepared to exploit these; and that is why we voted to remain.   It is not from a woolly-minded vision of EUtopia that we voted, but a hard-headed assessment of how the UK’s weak educational system, protectionist instincts, and low-calibre leadership make it unfit to challenge the world alone.  And that is without mentioning the issues we face on Scottish and NI independence, with Wales and English regions to follow.  We are not flag wavers, but hard-headed pragmatists.
1	Looks like British will have an Independence Day of their own,. Congratulations!!!
0	Nicola Sturgeon needs to wake up from the fairy tale she has lied to every Scottish citizen
0	A good video, with some real people, not the fake lying scumbags we normally see referring to Brexit. Yes people would vote to leave if there was another vote offering leave as an option, which is why the remainers dont want leave as an option on a ballot of a 2nd vote. And its very true how can leaving the EU make the poor even poorer when they already have virtually nothing, as the man said he is left with just £10 a month to live on, so they dont care about all the lies/fear spreading, because in truth if it does go bad if we end up with a no deal exist that is down to the MPs for not preparing for a no deal exist, which was always a possibility, like they never prepared for a leave result, you cant blame the leave voters for any of that.
1	Not doing muc for the ‘proBrexit’ case and ‘bringing us all together’
0	This country was fine in my opinion before Brexit, so let's all settle down.
0	Together we stand. Divided we fall. Weakens the world, if you really leave.
0	Britain tbh is committing suicide. It's economy will never be good.
0	free scotland from english rule
1	so opportunties for skilled UK workers - or what happens to all the graduates flipping burgers?
1	Up you ante, UK, put your money, where… well, you know. But please, make sure you see it through this time. Too good to be part? Fair enough, and fairwell. We wish you no ill. Just don’t come back anytime soon.
0	i see prices of items/foods are gonna go up next year
1	We need someone to demonstrate the wrong construction and development of the EU.
0	I'm against us leaving the EU. For many reasons. Mainly because I distrust every politician who says we should leave (and what few politicians I do respect enough to have a modicum of trust for are also against leaving the EU) and I have absolutely no truck with the mainstream media scaremongering. I absolutely do not believe that staying in the EU will lead to a flood of refugees 'invading' our country. I absolutely believe staying in the EU gives us more protections from greedy corporate bastards who don't give a fuck about anything other than their swelling bank balances.
1	If we don’t leave on the 31st then the UK would have signed away its Democracy, Sovereignty and Beliefs.
0	REMAIN IN EU
0	So we are now officially prisoners on Brexshit Island. Thankfully there are no fireworks to rub it in and make the pain worse. A very sad day indeed.
0	Sooner or later, they'll realize that they have set themselves in a dead-end...
0	The victory of total idiocy over reason! Sad to attend such events without being able to stop them. Perhaps also in the United States ... I must feel what an educated democrat must have felt in Germany in the 1930s.
1	The Britz voted with clarity and courage. Be proud U.K.. Better days ahead. Down for the EU. Down for Labour.
0	Johnny Foreigner's point of view  I've been working in the UK for some years. I needed to seek a medical attention only once, in five years - a sprained wrist due to a bike accident. While I've been contributing into the NHS since the day one.   I have never been unemployed for longer than ten days, or have received a single penny of benefits or any support. I pay tax and national insurance as everyone else who's legally employed.   Regarding the NHS situation:  Fewer migrants won’t necessarily mean shorter A&amp;E queues when migrants are more likely to be in A&amp;E as doctors and nurses than as patients.  Don't blame the immigrants, they do come to fill a gap on market, they do take jobs that no one else is willing to do anyway.  It's not a poor immigrants fault that incompetent governments or councils haven't invested enough into the housing and schools.  Especially during a "good years" when the economy has been flourishing, underpinned by the influx of skilled workers from Eastern Europe after the 2004.  What's the worst outcome apart from economic stagnation and uncertainty -  The voices of bigoted, racist primitives became loud and confident. What they used to dare to say only in their living rooms, they can say on the street, in a bus or at work now.  I witnessed it personally that before 2016 people have been much more careful not to be nasty to anyone, hiding it behind politeness. They've simply dropped all the pretence. No wonder, Murdoch's press have done an amazing job pitching hate and lies.
0	Britain shrinks to a sort of economic 'Middling Britain', useful for some great shopping and often great theatre, but not to be seen as a serious global player anymore
1	HIP HIP HOORAY!🇬🇧
0	Mighty UK will discover that when it comes to negotiations the big boys don't take any prisoners
1	When will these whining gits get it?  We're leaving.  The EU are the enemy.  Suck it up.
0	We should of stayed in the EU.
0	Genuinely I am thinking of moving country because of this, people here have become unbearable to work and live with.
0	A sad day. More years of even worse financial hardship to come. Hopefully it won't take too long to rejoin. My European flag will be prominently on display until that day comes.
0	I've never felt so useless or ashamed or saddened by the nation in which I was born. I am a citizen of the EU and I am about to be stripped of that citizenship against my will.
0	This is a very unreasonable stance from the brits and it will only make Europe stronger. The EU must do what's best
1	As to a British exit from the EU. That cannot come any sooner. The EU experiment is crumbling, borders are being flagrantly disregarded by all and sundry and the leaders of most every country within have little to zero answers to the solution.
1	Brexit revisited: That was awesome.
0	You've just sold a key defence company to US asset strippers Advent. Its UK director said "even if Brexit were ultimately a good thing, it would create “significant challenges” and cause the UK to lose out on investment" He applied for Cypriot citizenship in 2018. #UKForSale
1	Congrats Britain !
0	Why did they vote leave? Cos they're uneducated.
0	Finally got our country back
0	If it was an anti Brexit party it would have been reported as millions. The media have been the true protagonist, for over 3 years they have been setting remainer against leaver with their completely fabricated or subjective fake news...time they were called out on their BS.
0	The Dutch aren't that bothered that much anymore I think. Business in particular has already moved on and there's a lot of talk about the opportunities Brexit creates (rather than the challenges). A lot of debate about the value or otherwise of immigration but almost no respect for how they might feel as human beings. Nobody will come out of this well.
0	Well Boris this is another fine mess you've got us into. Pleased with yourself?
1	The good people of these lands voted and won - we won.
0	Heartbroken. The scientific community overwhelmingly opposed this. If sanity prevails, please let us come back, friends
1	GOOOOOD JOB! The EU must collapse
1	The fact EU law overrides UK law is reason enough to leave
1	Brexit - as good as it gets.
0	Because over half the U.K. population (including Scotland) are anti-Brexit too - Even in the most recent Prof Curtice’s What UK Thinks Poll of Polls. And the You Gov 26/1/20 poll.
0	UK has never been more separated  until Brexit.
1	Such a pity - it was a good idea when it was the Common Market. We’ve had co-operation between Europe’s countries for decades - Europol and Euratom long precede the EU, Concorde was up and running as an Anglo-French project long before anyone had heard of open borders or the single currency. The problem is that politicians always want more and more power, so having started something useful for helping trade, they turned it into a one-size-fits-all, single-currency bloc. Then they expressed surprise that political parties were formed in many member-countries to oppose that.
0	I can't believe all the Brexiters on here saying that the EU can't tell us what to do because we are now an independent and sovereign country - as if we weren't one before, only now we haven't got any friends or allies!
1	I'm going to have your back no matter which way you decide to go with this.  I understand the justification for it, but maybe the short-term pain isn't worth the long term gain?  Maybe it is?  Maybe it's overstated anyway?  I don't know.  Whatever you do about this I'll be a fan of your country.
0	Project Get Brexit Done is nearly finished, project Keep Stiff Upper Lip will begin shortly!
0	Let's stay together
1	BBC is so fake news. They continue to promote stories that Remainers were in majority. Why does Brits have to pay license fee to support such leftist propaganda.
1	I wobbled a bit this morning when I saw the reactions on Facebook. Around 98% of my Facebook friends were strongly remain. At our staff briefing the headteacher talked about it being a bad day. All my colleagues seemed to have voted remain, so I’ve kept my vote private. I’ve yet to come out on Facebook and I’m not sure I will, as I may have a lot of anger thrown at me.  The EU is doomed to fail in the long- to very-long term, and Britain will do very well outside it. The EU is undeniably failing economically, and its principal solution seems to be increasing what is most likely to be causing the failure.  I can foresee popular movements against the EU rising in several countries, indeed they already seem to be starting in the countries that have been in the EU the longest. It could become, as it has in the UK, an easy target for disaffected people to lash out at.  I’m a Green party member. I think Labour have a strong chance in the next general election, and hopefully they can introduce proportional representation to produce the progressive, coalition government this country could have.
1	There was NEVER any intention by the EU dictatorship to give the UK a deal as they don't want other countries to leave when they see the whole of the UK prosper outside of the Failing corrupt,unelected EU
1	Dump all remainers
0	As a Scotsman, I voted yes for independence and no to Brexit
1	I think it’s a great move, to be in control of your own country.
0	Brexit will possibly even take the UK back to our standing before we were in the EU (which of course would be an absolute disaster - we joined because the country was quite literally failing)
1	I am voting Leave. I don't really like the idea of eurocrats in brussels  deciding my future. I have found it amazing seeing friends on Facebook  shout passionately about how voting In is the only choice and that  believing anything other that that makes me an idiot racist. I have  found the In campaign to be the vocal minority. I turn on sky news and  it is just seems to be pushing doom and gloom for the UK economy if we  leave. The current government just seems to be pushing fear and I am  really bored of it.  To say that the only way that we can exist as part of Europe and will only prosper as part of it, seems idiotic to me.
1	Still hoping that this is actually a nightmare and I will wake up any minute now
1	Congratz England!!Goodluck!!
1	My book from 2014 - after Brexit more important than ever!
1	One thing is for sure we couldn't go on with the uncertainty of the last 3 years.At least we can move forward now.
1	Great (patriotic) speech!! UK democracy has won the war!!
0	We're finished as a country unless we ignore the referendum result, that's the reality. I don't really care whether that defies democracy, the fact it we're better off in. Our elected MPs must act to keep us in. However if we actually do leave then I and many others will leave this country for good
1	Isn't it great to be the out of the EU ?  Like having escaped alive from a burning building, we can now watch as it self-destructs from a safe distance.
0	When the full facts of the disaster called Brexit hits home only then will the leavers realise what a con job was done on them
1	VOTE LEAVE!
0	A lot of poor people are going to die because of this.
0	World: Electing Trump is the stupidest thing we’ve ever seen. Britain: Hold my beer!
0	"Britain is basically Pompeii if the Pompeii had voted for the volcano" ... I'm DEAD! :p
1	Brexit is good, UK won't be any poorer if they were to stay
1	I understood the message from Boris! We Europeans are undesirable as long as we don't give UK power and money
1	Fail to prepare, prepare to fail. This Government is preparing to succeed. Already they've engaged the services of 700 lawyers to oversee numerous trade contracts outside of the EU.
0	Waiting for the news about starvation
1	I actually think that if people voted remain and they've still not got over it as of 31/01/2020, then they should probably be having a long hard think as to whether the UK is the country for them to stay in.
0	The daily mail should be ashamed of themselves encouraging the grey market to vote this way. The hard working youth of today will be paying for this editorial genius for years, bravo the daily mail .
0	Borris Johnson said, the UK will not comply by EU standards on social protection or environmental regulations.  Well, I guess the UK better get ready for high tariffs and boycotts of its goods and services.
0	My big worry is that a zero or rubbish deal next year will push most of the continent into recession (including us) and average Europeans (not politicians I mean) start blameing the Brits for the consequences. Europeans have been pretty benign about Brexit but that could change if they start losing their jobs or houses over it. Worried the worst relations could be yet to come
0	Let's cancel it instead please. It's not working, and it's very expensive.
0	As I say goodbye to another friend this week leaving the UK for a job in the EU I am still at an utter loss as to why we are doing this. There are no benefits in my mind in a world where we need allies and friends across the world to combat climate change. It makes no sense to me and the hate filled comments and gloating of the leavers makes it unbearable.
0	Good luck with that Boris. Looks like no deal then. What a shambles this is turning out to be.
1	I'm a Corbyn supporter who would vote to leave the EU tomorrow, if I was given the chance, after their meddling in Ukraine, the way they treated Greece.
1	Surely if a Country has left we need 73.MEPs less ,maybe it was too long ago that I learnt my sums
1	Don’t listen to the remainers they have a extremely low standards ! Raise your standards high uk
0	Decades of ANTI EU media has brainwashed Brexiteers into the idea that the EU was bad...It isn't Bad but actually benefits UK in a huge way
0	I'm just curious how the UK will negotiate with the EU by the end of the year when they don't even know what they want...well at least it's not going to  be boring
0	Always know what's on the ballot. Big oops.
0	Hmm what a childish nationalist mess this country is in. Fuck me the U.K. is just turning into one big steaming pile of a nationalist shithole before our very eyes.
1	And yet remainiacs told us that Britain would have to apply to join the WTO but would be vetoed by Argentina
1	We right behind you Boris. power to the people . @JamesLarkhill @BorisJohnson you are the Man
0	I seriously hope the UK does NOT LEAVE THE EU :( The fact that we're even having a vote makes me sad!
0	Just wait for Project BLAME to start
0	Welcome to the dehumanisation of Britain
1	Happy Independence Day!
1	Let freedom reign!
1	That is so great ! Seeing Britons wave their flag a proudly as we in the USA wave ours ! Happy Independence Day UK !
0	English company:- Hurrah, Boris got #Brexit done....now we can sell our gizmos all over the world.    Me:-Excellent.  I'll buy 2 of your finest gizmos.   English Company:-Sorry ..does not post to highlands and islands..... (you see the problem here)?
1	For heavens sake : GO AND VOTE if you want Brexit to happen!
0	Decades of ANTI EU media has brainwashed Brexiteers into the idea that the EU was bad...It isn't Bad but actually benefits UK in a huge way
0	Bad idea.
0	Lol. I am so prowd to Say I am European, But I seen in this video some proper narrow minded people. Im prowd to be European and I dont have to leave the live some have. Lol Their been stealing our jobs, lol Why Am I the at the bottom of the list ? Because of incompetence and because they keep their hands to fall from the sky. Damn some people i cannot believe it. IF you have British passport that does not mean your British... It only fucking means you have a British Passport...
0	The EU is not the common market. It is the single market. Which means saying no to diversity, to national autonomy and independence.
1	Very happy for the UK! But I hope you're ready to fight, cuz now they're gonna tear Scotland out of the UK.
1	TODAY is the United Kingdom's INDEPENDENCE DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1	Evidence that all the EU's "warm words" about still wanting to be "friends" are about as trustworthy as the legendary crocodile's smile! Our continuing frienddhip will be with the people of Europe, as ever, not the institution that we have just left.
0	That is the Britain that I used to know and love...
0	I voted Leave during the referendum, and whilst I stand by my reasons for this initial vote, I came to change my view over the course of the absolute nightmare that has been Brexit.
1	Democracy, integrity, and self-determination win through at last
1	We joined an economic union back in the 70s, and by the end of the 90s  this union had become a political one, which a court and parliament that  made ours no long supreme or sovereign.  How people can want to preserve this baffles me- I'm willing to  accept a few potential years of economic recession if it means self  governance.   800 years ago we created the magna carta, and nearly 400 years ago we  fought a civil war over the unelected creating laws for the people. The  European union in its current state of federalism  makes both of these  events irrelevant.
1	we must leave in March 2019, with no transition period at all. The boots on our feet
0	And moreover Brexit will be a drag on every sector of our society. To make it a success would require a tremendous will and work from the entire population.
1	Pissed theyâ€™ve lost all that tax revenue.
1	The Guardian has become a left wing paper which is the conduit for sensationalism, innuendo and downright lies. Fit for lining cat litter trays and bird cages at best.
0	So far Brexit has been a political disaster.
1	The EU is behaving just like an obsessive, abusive, possessive partner who can't accept that their abused partner has left the relationship. We will no longer be dictated to, and any deal will be discussed as EQUALS, which is what we are now. If they don't like it, there are plenty more fish in the sea (and all the ones around our coastline will belong to OUR fishermen!
0	Its actually embarrassing watching them play at being macho.
0	There is no evidence for this madness. There is no way some notional boost in trade with China or the US can compensate for what “hard” Brexit would cost the economy.
0	The biggest lie of this whole Brexit saga is that those who want to leave are 'racist' or 'xenophobic'. There is nothing wrong with wanting a controlled immigration system.
1	Farage will be remembered well by history
0	so now brits threaten the EU
0	Voting to stay in. We are stronger in Europe - not just economically.  The EU is an amazing thing - all these countries who've fought each  other - working together. I'm proud to be English & I'm proud to be  part of the EU too.
0	The EU stop corporations from forcing them to work 60 hour weeks. Stop animal testing. Stop lethal chemicals from being tested off the coast for oil clean up. Stop the UK Government from selling off the NHS so fast. Stop corporations from putting a patent on seeds & genes in livestock like in USA so that Farmers can't collect a wage. They stopped the bill to get rid of Sick pay & Holiday entitlement. They limited the amount of overtime you can do. They stopped the use of anti-flammable blood anti-coagulants being used in daily products because they care about LIFE before profits.   I will forever hate all those block-headed morons who voted to leave because this country is about to go down hill FAST. In just 5 years, everything will turn to shit. The corporations will own everything, Government will have no power, the Media will brainwash with forced ways of advertising, pensions will be gone, you'll have to PAY for a GP Appointment, for the NHS visits, deals with the USA will turn farms into factories (MONSATO), the price of produce will sky rocket, exports/imports will cost shed loads more because Canada, China, India, Australia etc are so far away (duh?) & we have forever locked out our neighbouring allies all because of all these dense people who reacted on pure HATRED without the benefit of intellect.
0	The next 5 years is on you David.
0	Do you remember when the UK was a great place to live? Whatever happened to that country!
1	Im glad the people in uk woke up
1	Leave means leave. Sign the UK open petition for a no deal Brexit  323,621 agree. MBGA
0	To all those Brexiters telling people to "get over it" and "you lost" when commenting on any post that refers negatively on Brexit... do you not see how these comments reflect so badly on yourself and see why the Remainers have such a problem with those that voted to leave the EU? The only logical reason I can see for you posting the way you are, is that you don't give two flying f**ks about the country you live in anyway, because in case you didn't notice, a struggling economy benefits very few and the poorest are always hit the hardest... so I have to conclude that your patriotic views can only be posturing, as flushing the country down the toilet is obviously anything but patriotic.
0	That’s the point.  If you voted Brexit, you lost. If you voted Tory, you lost. Even if you’re rich, you lost. Because everyone else did.
0	Gams don't do evidence or reason. That's why Brexit is going to fail.
0	Brexit is an ugly thing, spearheaded by ugly men with ugly intentions
0	Fishing contributes about 1% of our economy. Only brexiteers would be stupid enough to value fishing over our services sector which makes up 80% of the economy.
1	This is our country, this is our people. We aren't gonna fall because we've got eachother.  Be proud of our flag be proud of our name, we are the UK and we're going to shine once again
0	We need the EU, especially for the future, without it we’re going to have a hard time as single nations in an ever more competitive world.
1	Fantastic. We have our country back. Make our own laws, not be part of a Europe going nowhere.
1	‘at less we will now be exploited by real British politicians and not EU one’
0	udged by AEP prophecies in the past about the demise of the € the European  Union will enjoy a brilliant future in contrast to Little England.
0	When the original vote was subject to serious amounts of manipulation, fear-mongering and other tactics, then why should it stand?
1	Job done. The UK is out, the rest is just details.
1	Vote LEAVE!!!!!
1	Well it's finally about time. The people of U.K. have been waiting for this for a long long time
0	I want to stay in the EU because I don't want to see those jobs go..and the workers being left in the same state we were.
0	It will impact not only UK  and existing members of the EU but also the rest of the countries.
0	I've from UK and just voted to remain today and to say thank you TYT support.
1	How will Christmas dinner be different after Brexit?No Brussel
0	What is going to be of this ex wonderful country with Boris and Farage leading?
0	I haven’t seen that many White Nationalists since Trump’s last Hate Rally.
1	Once we’ve left the EU, we will be sovereign and free (whatever that means). Our skilled negotiators (led by dead-beats such as Liz Truss) will strike a free-trade deal with Japan, something the Brussels bureaucrats could never pull off.
1	Really, even though I disagree in full with your statement, you’re still entitled to your opinion; brexit is pretty great!
0	Brexit is a stupid idea and it is not going to work without a great deal of unnecessary pain to the economy.
1	why dose this matter to you so much if we're the ones lossing out? We made a choice and we will live with it. It has nothing to do with anyone else this was not hate towards the people of Europe this was a choice to get us out of an undemocratic union.
1	left loses again lol
1	I seem to recall a certain little corporal, who had also over-run Europe,  threatening us in 1939.  Our response was two fingers.  The same again is indicated now.     The Eurocrats are being sore losers, financially and emotionally, they are trying to control us - yet again - because they fear Great Britain succeeding, which it will, without their control and over-lordship.  Where Britain leads - others will follow.    Brexit lunch happening in Australia for us-expats at an English pub with proper English bitters.  We shall be toasting our Independence Day.   God Save The Queen, for nothing can save the EU!
1	screw eu and ur unity !
0	I'm voting remain. the EU is a known system, leaving is a risk we don't need to take. Plus I like being part of a larger system, unlike some of my countrymen I don't view the UK as some islands far away from europe. Plus in my more naive moments I like to imagine that this sort of large union could lead to the utopian future I read in sci-fi novels as a kid.
1	I'm an American, but I 100% support British freedom from foreign fascism. Hope that a 'big, beautiful' trade deal with the U.S. is soon to follow… Congratulations to the UK…
0	Brexit has done the rest of the EU countries a great favour. It’s such a self-evidently stupid move to make that it’s killed off all the similar right-wing ’exit’ policies across the EU. Here in Sweden the only two political parties who had ’Swexit’ as part of their programmes quietly dropped the idea about 2 years ago.
0	Brexiteers deserve all the job losses and hardship heading their and their family’s way.
1	The equivalent of 19 smaller EU states have just walk out the door taking our money and our fish with us. Isn't it time we told the EU what they can and cannot have. The writing is on the door for this corrupt EU project. Once again it is us, the UK that had the guts to take on Germany and we won again.
1	What a beautiful moment. Congrats to all the Brits who never gave up.
1	The PEOPLE voted, brainwashed, uneducated, spineless europhiles need to stop weeping and gnashing their teeth and accept the DEMOCRATIC result
0	Wow fell like children should have had a vote because we should have a better future and not have to worry about what will happen
0	Boris Johnson's Brexit is opposed by 2/3 top Brexit parties. Boris Johnson's Brexit is opposed by 250K leave-voting unionists. Boris Johnson's Brexit is opposed by 2/4 countries of UK. Boris Johnson's Brexit is opposed by the 53% who voted for 2nd referendum parties. #NotMyBrexit
1	Congrats to UK - Independence Day!
1	The EU... is the enemy of the world.
0	Took some stuff to the local tailor today for repair. She’s Austrian, with a British Husband. Runs a small business in the Town and does great work. Chatting about #BrexitDay and she said yesterday a customer told her to ‘go back to her own country.’ This is what Brexit enables.
0	Brexit - A terrible decision.
0	It begins infidels. Brexit was a hell of a battle. This is the actual war.
1	best thing i ever did was vote leave
0	Strange, one of the reasons for Brexit was that they wanted more democracy. First they send they send the parlement and now they send the journalists home. Uk be on the lookout, these are dangerous times!
1	Jog on you lefty tossers! The EU is dead and they just haven't  figured it out yet.
0	Everyone celebrating for this Brexit..wow, Hopefully Britain will be save from Thieves and Robbers, Because, everywhere polish, and Romanian people involved..what I've seen in the last five years, experience, has many proofs around us
1	To be honest we weren't the little guy, we were the biggest MAJORITY, it was just the minority that kicked, screamed and cried at everything the MAJORITY did! It's like the old saying goes, "shy bairns get nowt” they got what they deserved!
1	EU - the club that losers want to join.
0	Nothing happy about this day whatsoever
1	If it was so great they wouldn't be leaving, the rest of them are so jelous
0	Congratulations Brits! Got your country back. Hope it's not too late.
0	It’s #BrexitEve today, so remember to put your clocks back to 1973 before you go to bed.
1	Once they see how Much more successful the UK is outside - they will be lining up to leave. The EU know it
1	I voted OUT.
1	I don't think people will just completley halt trading with us once we leave the EU.  Also, the EU costs us quite a lot of money (£350 million a week IIRC)  which could be used for other things, like improving the NHS for both  the public and the employees of it. Fair Pay for those hard-working,  dedicated people has never been the same since George Osborne royally  fucked over their wages.
0	And from tomorrow onwards when we see Tax Rises, Cost of Food Rises ect ect, that is when we will regret leaving the EU
0	Against. Not at all convinced that the good things the EU spends money on in the UK (infrastructure, science etc) would be spent in a similarly wise way by Westminster. Also concerned about the risk to the City - afraid they will lose business to Frankfurt.
1	The European Union is antidemocratic and the enemy of every nation state on this continent.  That is the only fact you require.
1	The article fails to discuss the constitutional position of Britains citizens. I want out because I don't want to give away my rights to self-determination, I don't want to sign over power of attorney to a corporate and political elite.
1	If you think 2013/14 was bad, the next crisis will be blow-out horrible. All we can do to protect ourselves is to decouple our economy from the EU's so we're not dependent on them in any way.
0	You can invest in schools and the NHS better by not doing Brexit and you know it
0	You won. Get over it - and take responsibility for what you voted for.
1	Off we go, and no remoaners - I don't mean your imaginary cliff.
0	I'm Scottish and I voted no. As soon as my country regains its Independence, it will rejoin the EU. Flame away you brexiteer fuckheads.
0	Happy trip back to the middle ages England
1	This all boils down to the fact that the EU does not favour competition. It wants to ensure that there is none. This is proved by the fact that it wants to prevent its biggest export market having a successful economy by refusing a reasonable trade deal because that market might become too competitive. No country would ever demonstrate such stupidly, only an undemocratic bureaucracy unanswerable to its own people.
0	I agree with Macron, this is a lose lose, but a huge ammount is going to depend on whether the current both hard and yet utterly unclear line that Johnson is taking is the act or the reality of his actual ambitions...
0	There is huge inequality in the EU. Bulgaria uses horse drawn carts. Poland has abysmally low wages. This goes on. British companies love this
0	Strange how we left EU and are now wanting to have the same trade deals as if we are still members. We have left, expect less. Johnson is trying to get back into the womb.
1	Hard Brexit then. Problem solved.
0	Yes, it'll be the greatest act of unforced national self-harm, in modern history.
1	well boys, they did it #BrexitDay
1	now we need to give Boris our support we don't need the EU
0	Haha, gonna be fun to watch the island sink while the rats are clapping their own doom...
1	We want a no deal Brexit, we want a no deal Brexit, a no deal Brexxxxxit, we want a no deal Brex-it
0	Nothing the EU has ever done validates this high handed, dictatorial approach.
1	For the first time in a long time I feel proud to be British
0	It makes me feel like the US and Britain are in some weird competition to out-moron each other
1	No more bureaucracy
1	And yet tomorrow nothing will have changed, we will all still be Europeans of course, still subject to the same rules and laws, but now without any say in how they are implemented. The only other difference is that it will be a Saturday, I do like Saturdays.
1	Happy Brexit Day everyone !:)
0	The European Union is a failed experiment, member countries refuse oversight or accountability for trade agreements
0	The eu is stronger than ever now. No one wants to leave now they have seen the absolute shambles of Brexit.
0	The price of Brexit is the destruction of the United Kingdom.
1	Will this mean the eu nationals already here will have to return home i hope so then if they want to come bac they would have to pass checks etc
0	I personally think it was a huge mistake and a bad thing for the UK and EU.  Secretly, it makes me laugh and I'm very entertained watching the "enlightened" Europeans experiencing the very things they often lecture others about. Hard to criticize others when your union is starting to literally fall apart from the inside out. How could that possibly be?
0	Jesus fcukin H Christ!, this is the kind of things dictators like Trump do, solve a problem by banning officials from talking about it. Let’s also not forget that Johnson has advised people to ignore the BBC and is trying to prevent access for news agencies that decry his actions!
0	We must NEVER give up! Rejoiners unite! Let's be defiant and organise.
0	According to Bloomberg Economics, by the end of this year Brexit will have cost Britain some £200bn in lost economic growth – nearly as much (adjusted for inflation) as the country has paid in to the EU budget over the entire period of its membership since 1973.
1	Congratulations British people for your brave votes against globalists and liberal mafia.
0	Hopefully they realise what most people realised from day one that is an awful idea and the whole thing gets cancelled, I know there was a vote by the public but a lot of the public are too stupid to see what is bad for them.
1	Salty MEP tears. MEPs are unskilled, talentless pen pushers. So happy to see them unemployed. No one will hire them.
1	Localism won, it's good; every country faces different situations that are better to handle bottom up, in the smaller and closer scale. Of course it's not everything better, but overall it is
0	wish we stayed but does it really make a difference?
0	I am ready to campaign with all my heart and soul to keep Britain inside a reformed European Union
1	Brexit=Freedom
1	We will now have true democracy once again. We will be able to take proper control of our boarders to keep out health and economic migrants, along with the bogus refugees. We will also be able to negotiate trade deals with the rest of the free world, without the stranglehold dictats of the EU beurocrats. Because the changes will be gradual, most people won't notice much difference for quite a while. But once the country finds it's new freedoms, I think we will see things change for the better.
0	Tonight's prayer - that my kids may get to see the UK returning to the European family
0	The argument to leave has always been flimsy, let’s revoke and retain control of our destiny and get in with the important things.
0	I don't think anyone felt opressed by the EU until the idea of Brexit was pushed on everyone
1	The European Union is toxic the United Kingdom did the right thing leaving that garbage tlnow they can have real independence and make their own laws and have a real border without having to ask EU what ot can do.
0	And I thought the british were intelligent people....
1	Congrats to the UK and wish them the very best in their sovereignty and independence.
1	It’s done. Today we will finally leave the EU. #BrexitDay
0	so scotland wants to be independent and then join the EU.....
1	The UK WILL NOT ALLOW THE EU TO CONTROL anything any more, nothing. For too long, they have even told us what time it is. #Brexit #Leave #EU #SundayMorning #SundayThoughts #Brexit50p #Marr #SundayBrunch
0	The biggest mistake we have ever made.
1	Who wants the EU to infantalize them.
1	We as one in a year will be a force to be reconstructed to the power of what we were never released to be.now WE CAN SAY WITH PRIDE ONCE AGAIN WE WILL NEVER SURRENDER..…
0	This is the UK decay
1	If the "experts" were able to correctly anticipate the future with a reasonable probability, then they'd be entrepreneurs acting on their anticipations to participate in and contribute to the productive economy, not policy wonks. In other words, those who are poor at anticipating the future pontificate rather than participate.
1	The best thing the UK has done is voted to LEAVE this corrupt EU and may all the European countries do the same only then Europe will grow stronger and all the peoples take back their countrie and power and unite and take back control from their servants..
0	I don’t know what’s worse: waking up to #Brexit, or having Jonathan Freedland at the top of my Guardian news feed.
1	make Britain great again, and lets start with all the people that shouldn't be here, or are here and serve no purpose other than take take take, time to go home.
0	I phoned ITN newsdesk, about a segment a reporter did on Dutch fishermen livelihoods being affected by Brexit
1	God Bless Merry Old England.
1	Britain and America are God’s children. Britain is finally free.
1	No translation error with me: Good riddance to the EU! EU’s last words to UK before Brexit were ‘goodbye and good
0	The rational world looks on..and they are ashamed for many Brexiteers. I'm afraid to say, but the overs, the uneducated and bottom feeders of the UK (with a tiny sprinkling of those who should be brighter) did this.
0	Ah well, fuck it, they've been told repeatedly it was a bad idea from the start, so if it goes through we just move onto holding them to account for their lies and deceit made to the British public as the country progressively gets poorer and their deception is laid bare.
0	I wish Britain weren't so small minded, I want to stay in Europe and the eu but it will never happen until everyone who is a teen now becomes 18 and all the racists die off
1	Overthrowing a democratic election..... What could go wrong??
1	That was true in the Brexit Bashes in pubs around the country too.
1	One of the happiest days in my life
0	Division is anti progress
1	Well obviously German citizens don't consider the UK a part of Europe for a while now. When traveling last year I had a smartass Passport control agent laugh at me when I referred to England as Europe. So good riddance to the EU and more power to you, get on with it. You will enhance your strengths, and conttol your own destiny.
0	It seems that they're having fine time in Parliament these days. Apparently they haven't fathomed the fact that they are down the drain if they don't remain a member of the most significant European organization in all of history. It seems they have never realized the importance of having a European Germany rather than a German Europe. Rescind the Brexit-nonsense, call off the "divorce". We all want you among us, the united peaceful European Nations. Why indeed antagonize yourselves from the obvious common good? In many ways you are special, but NOT that special! Greetings from Denmark.
0	I voted Leave for a variety of reasons. The biggest one e was the promise of extra funds for the NHS followed closely by the fact that I was on the way out of various YouTube conspiracy rabbit holes and I was still anti Big Government. A lot has changed since that vote and a lot of lies and false promises were dolled out to the Public.  I definately fucked up in voting leave. This isn't a reason for voting again as the info to counteract my views was there, I just didn't look for it. But the sheer amount of lies told to us at the time by the Leave campaign should give us the right to vote again.  What I have noticed is that a large number of people who say they would vote leave again are older people whose futures are relatively secure.
0	This is the most stuppidest thing I've ever hered or seen in my life WHO CARES
1	For the first time in 37 years the UK can be a UK!! A sovereign nation with its own laws, Monarchy , Parliament and endless opportunities for growth. An opportunity to grow manufacturing in the UK. GREAT TIMES A HEAD. The pound has not sunk. The sky has not caved in !!
1	I feel sorry for the BBC. All their biased reporting against leaving and they still couldn’t turn the public. Probably because most people don’t even watch the rubbish they churn out !
0	Let’s hope we are not sleep walking towards an exit from the EU
0	Never forgive and never forget this shower of charlatans and their inane three-word slogans and years of lies and poisonous propaganda
0	This is ridiculous everything that happens in this bloody country country they blame the emigrants lol wtf the main problem is the Eastern European’s is sad really the black girl she said we take their job well they lazy to work lol
1	Britain DOES NOT exist to give foreigners a better life.
0	It'll be a cold and lonely experience. The nation has become an oxymoron - It's neither United nor Great any more - just a loose association of what could have been.
1	Out for god sake
1	Fundamentally I don't want Britain to be part of a European political union, and don't trust our political class to keep us from further integration. I didn't see Remain as anything more than a temporary "status quo" option and our apparent "opt out" from ever closer union wasn't worth the paper it was written on.
0	UK leaves the most wealthy club on the globe to keep the lowest life of standard.I hope that I am wrong
1	The British success story in a brilliant example: Jaguar Land Rover Slovakia is a Slovak subsidiary of the British car producer Jaguar Land Rover, itself a subsidiary of Tata Motors.The company produces Land Rover Discoveries in its factory in Nitra, where production started in October 2018.....OH!! How comes? Where is the British success??
0	So far we have only notionally "left" and we are already seeing the start of an economic downturn.
1	The eu can vote on whatever they like... We are off :)) Out of this corrupt, anti democratic, perk ridden, political amalgam... And it feels GREAT !! :)
1	This is a good piece. I would go so far as to say that had the EU fanatics foiled brexit I would have supported an armed uprising and I am a Mr goody two shoes. Thankfully we have avoided that and the destruction of our democracy. God bless the UK the British people and dear old Nigel farage who's family were put through hell by the crazy remainders.
1	Non skilled Europeans are already in their thousands in the UK. More have left the UK after grabbing a UK Social security number & are happily claiming child benefits, unemployment benefits & Incapacity allowance from UK taxpayers while living in EU. Leaches & parasites.
1	We Want Workers !, NOT Scoungers !
0	With the possible exception of selling our soul to Trump, we could have done all these things while we were in the EU
0	A lot of banning going on from this "free , democratic " government of ours , thought the tories were all about less regulation ?
0	I think my dad is one of few older people I've spoken to that doesn't want to leave the EU. I'm proud.
0	“Applicants must have the unrestricted right to live and work in the EU.” British only nationality not good enough.
0	I believe we should stay in purely because there's far too much to risk  if we leave. The Leave campaign cannot say anything with any certainty  because nobody has ever left the EU. They seem to make out that we would  be able to negotiate a utopian deal if we leave, particularly when it  comes to immigration and trade. However, I doubt it will be that simple.  If, for example, we were to leave and we still wanted to trade within  the single market/EU we will still have to contribute to the budget  without getting any say.   That being said, the reason why I'm voting in has nothing to do with  the In campaign. The campaigns for both sides have been shambolic and  full of lies and the media have behaved abominably as well.
1	EU is not a democratic institution, it is a complete technocracy  government ruled by lobbies ( a bit in an american fashion) with a bunch  of non-elected people deciding important laws over natonal sovereignty,    I can agree to a europe, but rather the europe of nations as De Gaulle put it,   the fact that the EU was initiated and created by two american agents  (Jean Monnet and Robert Schumann,) should tell us that EU was never  designed to make Europe stronger but rather the opposite,   I will agree that this brexit is a political demagogic scam, but I  actually hope it will crush the european union (not europe, I believe it  will be tough, but necessary to destroy this oligarchic tool)
0	FREE AT LAST !!!! GOD SPEED !!!!!
1	Congratulations❤ Now      #MakeBritainGreatAgain &stop the Islamic Invasion!
0	First for the sake of democracy, when can we see the RUSSIAN report.
1	WE THE WORKING CLASS WON
1	Clean brexit please
0	Voters reserve the right to change their minds. 00% and yet Europe should also reserve the right to say NO, as we have had enough.
1	Freedom U K
0	And Brexit just keeps on delivering the manure. Brexiteers - it is ALL YOUR FAULT from here on.
1	That’s it now I’m moving to bongo bongo land ... oh wait I’m already here
1	Save yourself from the EU.
0	I think we knew from day one that brexit is all about blaming immigrants for everything. Tragic nonsense - if you want to blame anybody for the deficiencies in your life you should start with the tories, thatcher and neoliberalism.
0	Not really surprising for May wanting to basically keep all benefits from the EU while ditching all obligations at the same point
1	My joy is only matched by sad remainers heartache
0	The GDP of the EU is bigger than the USA, and members get to trade in that enormous single market without restrictions on the movements of goods.
1	Looks lime the British have two holidays now in January. New Year eve and independence day.
1	We’ll never rejoin after all the benefits of Brexit are realised, the EU is hanging on by its fingernails anyway and difficult to see it surviving for many more years - it needs total reform but the people with the power to allow that are unelected and too deeply ingrained in the corruption!
0	40% England gas is from EU 6% England Electric is from EU Scotland exports power to England Loch Ness has more water than England 30% of English food consumed is from EU 53% of English imports are from EU (8% of EU exports) 45% of all English exports are to EU
0	So now non-politicians are being forced to lie
0	Until the Scots vote of independence
1	31th of January for Europe is like 4th of July for America ...the day when we got rid of England
0	There is no `coming together' , I want to disassociate completely from Brexiteers and everything they represent.
0	The only thing saving Britain now is common wealth countries. Watch the pound go further down
0	Can't remember who said it, but I have found the quote: "The EU is made up of small nations and nations that don't realize that they are small yet".   A country of 10-60 million doesn't have the influence (as in possible market) needed on the world stage to promote it's values and protect it's citizens from countries and corporations alike.
0	And soon Scotland and Northern Ireland will leave the U.K. in response. The Kingdom is shrinking...
1	they should leave so we and the rest of the EU can finally work on our European superstate without disturbing party poopers. They have slowdown the european integration long enough.
1	I am from Dublin Ireland  and I think we should leave the EU well done Uk
1	I think weve subsidised the poorer countries of the EU for long enough. Time to put our own people first!
0	Leavers should take a lesson in keeping their mouths shut.    They lost.    Nothing more to say.
0	I guess nobody is surprised by this obvious act of xenophobia because this is EXACTLY WHAT the Brexiters voted for. Afterall, they elected Boris Watermelon Smile Letterbox Johnson to be their PM.Hence, I will never unite nor support this xenophobic racist Brexit.
0	Anger as Gove claims UK doesn’t ‘need’ trade deal with EU
1	Tonight we have left the EU - an extraordinary turning point in the life of this country. Let us come together now to make the most of all the opportunities Brexit will bring - and let’s unleash the potential of the whole UK.
1	Congratulations to all of my friends in the UK
1	I do not think Islamic immigrants integrate well into society.
0	I say give us a second referendum. Give us a chance to stop this nonsense.
1	The EU like the UN are globalist organisations with unelected members who only care about making evil corporations richer
1	Independence Day...UK will BE great again....!!!!!!!!!
1	Always united? We were never united even when we were part of the Eu! The only thing the Eu cares about is the UK taxpayer money. Good riddance.
1	I personally find it unfair that law-abiding non-EU citizens who pay their dues in the UK have to face a disproportionate number of hoops to jump through in order to seek a future in the UK after graduating from university
0	Of course brexit will be a success...for its wealthy hedge fund backers.
1	I used to be pro-EU, then I realised what a fool I had been.
0	At last we are free from the land of TRASH.
1	Brexit will be worth it, and could deliver better accountability and control to the people of the UK.
1	However this is still a free country and we are free to reject it, while abiding by the law
0	Johnson wants the  benefits of a union but not the obligations. And do away with workers protections etc. while he‘s  at it. Working for his business friends, not for the people.
1	So they pledge to subvert a legal and democratic vote because they don't like it. Authoritarians come in many political flavors.
0	Congrats to UK for standing up for their sovereignty!!
0	According to Brexiteers, now that we've detached ourselves from the evil EU, we can now start to rebuild the British Empire. It's quite simply, we're going to order all the other countries to make a magical trade deal with us to our liking and all those that refuse we shall declare war on them and take what we want. There... Sorted!
0	Stop brexit !!!!
1	Is it something like a hate crime or just a sense that white people have been left behind?
1	It wasn't much of a party for me, I had a quiet and very enjoyable meal with friends, and broke my dry January with a decent single malt at the same time as raising a glass to Brexit. For me there's no triumph in it though, it's a sense of overwhelming relief that the right side won. It very nearly did not win. It almost lost to a crew of the ugliest characters in modern politics, thoroughly despicable people who had long ago effectively conspired to deliver the UK to the European Single Government trussed up like a Christmas turkey. They almost won, and they haven't given up yet.
1	Soon, very soon, they will be so glad they have left.  All of them.
0	So in short, a lot of us who do not want this shit are going to have to pay out a lot as it is shovelled on our heads.
1	I bet once boris gets tough with the EU, the EU will roll over like little puppy dogs.
1	Joining the EU is what fucked us in the first place. Leaving is part of the fix.
1	He also promised the DUP there would be no border down the Irish sea right up until he caved in to the EU's demands.
1	Well, Switzerland have been doing quite well without the EU!
1	I am a passionate, pragmatic, and positive believer in Brexit, and with my three-step plan, we can decisively leave the E.U.
1	I want to leave, not because im anywhere close to the right or because i hate europe, cause i dont. its actually because i feel the EU is a twisted state thats lied to us and is set to become the next fascist state, if america doesnt. it was promised to be the holy economic union that would "make europe great again" and instead its a political union that controls courts and parliaments and im not allowed to vote in anyway on how its run, where its run or its primary objectives. it controls me and my country in ways i deem unacceptable and this is the only way i could change it.
1	Good luck GB, be great again!
1	how condescending  "if you disobey the rules " this e.u. mafia really think they are superior to anyone or anything
1	Vote is closed. The full time result is up. Remainers 0 Brexit 1. Losers what you trying to change.  You lost  the match. You dont like it then go away.
1	The hell with the corrupt global socialists; God Bless the UK and the US.
0	So the fascists have won their coup in the UK, Farage and co. have got what they wanted
1	Wonderful news! Finally the voice of the people of the UK has been heard.
1	Mainly because I feel that in order to ensure that we remain a relatively free society (UK free lol I know) we cannot continue to support a continent-wide government that will only continue to absorb more and more power from the member states. The idea of federalisation is a leading light in the EU and it's a lot easier to put the boot down on a whole continent if you're governing the whole continent.
0	More like trying to pray for a miracle to get us out of the stupidity of the Brexiteers.
0	You realise that by having brexit they did an estimated £130bn of damage to the economy? (Until now, only to increase over time).
1	Less than 4 hours to go before we take a decisive step towards leaving the anti-democratic, corrupt and failing EU. Excellent.
1	Islamisation is the End of Europe and all of Europeans, through their indifference, are complicit. Because they abandoned their values ever since the ’cultural revolution’ of the ’70s and raised their children with comfort as the only value, they’re now reaping the consequences.  We’ve made the wisest choice, thanks God Britain is out !
1	Just watched the first of flags being removed from the EU Parliament. Only another 27 to go.
1	Finally something good happens with UK..
0	Wait, so are people actually stupid enough to believe that the Conservatives are going to bring economic justice northern England? Hahaha yeah whatever you say, buddy
0	This is a travesty for the average Brit.  Watch what will happen.  Prices will rise...jobs will get scarcer... it will be a disaster !
1	Congrats UK! This will be a good thing as long as you keep a very close eye on your politicians going forward. Best of luck from across the pond!
1	Everybody survived before the EU, Britain will survive after the EU.
0	Enjoy your chlorinated chicken, Brits.
0	i, like many my age, votes ‘remain’ it was (in the majority) the older generations who most likely won’t see the impact whom voted ‘leave’
1	Peter French another delusional remoaner, hate to break it to you but we are out and will forever remain that way.
1	Out of a dictatorship and political institution run by clowns that put themselves first and try preaching to us. Thankfully were out..we're now independent...u don't like it...the EU is just a short trip away
0	Living in Northern Ireland, I am concerned the effects a leave vote has on political stability here with votes having been cast upon traditional party lines – green and orange politics prevailing. The DUP supported Brexit while Sinn Féin were for remain. The latter have already called for a poll on Northern Ireland’s status within the UK, which will only serve to further complicate relations between Unionists and Nationalists. Nevertheless, what happens with the north/south border is a valid concern as bureaucratic measures will affect free movement and trade. We in Northern Ireland are, under the Good Friday Agreement, entitled to Irish citizenship and by extension, EU citizenship, but whether this claim to citizenship will now be dependent upon acquisition of an Irish passport is yet to be seen.  My main concern is what impact the leave verdict has upon jobs with so much employment, especially in the charity sector, dependent upon EU funding. Leave creates job uncertainty and is a huge snub to the immigrants living, studying, and working here. I cannot envision how Brexit is going to bring working-class unity. Instead, I imagine that it will result in reactionary policies that are only going to bring more social segregation and economic deprivation.
0	Happy Brexit
1	GOD BLESS NIGEL FARRAGE, I voted conservataive, but its due to this man, hes kept the issue under their noses. So well done.
0	The UK will do as it is told. The UK is negotiating from the weaker position.
0	There was a former great nation now sanctioning itself in favor of a set of illusions never woven before in history.
0	Seems Boris wants to cosy up with the US, the most protectionist country there is by far! So the UK is whistling by their tune then, allowing low health, safety and food standards, workers rights... Is this what you meant by "taking back control"?
1	What a lame headline. The UK did fine long before the corruption of the EU. They voted to leave and did. GLOBALIST news can stop the left media agenda anytime now.
0	I don’t think we should leave the EU
0	it is up to the government to act responsibly and find a way to cancel Brexit. The vote was a result of ingnorant people being told lies by Farage Boris and the like and believing them. The farmers are a prime example. The NHS will be even worse off. and and .
1	We in the USA look forward to a great trade deal with you.  Congratulations and #HappyBrexit
0	Remoaners, you were right, the sun has gone!
1	Democracy has won.
0	Why is this happening? Because fools voted for a pathological liar and he now has 5 years to do whatever the hell he likes. Democracy assumes the people you vote for are honest. When they're not, democracy dies. #LiarJohnson #ToryBrexit
1	Keep going, do not give in. Please keep fighting for us and do not let us down!
1	Really curious how the EU will function now that the UK has left. More countries to follow?
0	EU row looms as Macron demands even BIGGER budget despite €10bn Brexit black hole
0	This honestly makes me embarrassed to be British.
1	England has lived for centuries before the EU and will prosper after leaving.
1	Frankly I prefer to be dictated to & ruled over by people of my own country than foreign ones. That's Brexit in a nutshell & why I voted to Leave the EU.
0	We’ll  see what a sort of “ Fantastic , Robust Economy “ UK hides in his pocket !
1	We need to rule our own country! We need to create a more stable immigration system and we need to put British tax payers money into Britain not the EU where it is used to bail out every other country but our own!
0	To all the remainers, you have my most heartfelt sympathies.
1	It's a scary thing to imagine my bloodline mixing with cenks.
0	Oh don't fucking start. You got your bollocks Brexit. Enjoy it while you can before you start whingeing about Scexit
1	My vision for Britain's future was the Norway option - EFTA/EEA.
0	UK is part of the European Union. Looking at the past decades at the level of fundamental values, the European Union has achieved peace, democracy and respect for human rights in a large and growing part of the continent of Europe. The UK’s secession would weaken this transformative achievement. Overall, the evidence supports a common-sense view that British interests are best served by continuing membership of the EU.
0	FREEDOM...from The King-DUMB!!!
1	I have said all along they are terrified of losing control over us. With May this wasnt a problem as Selmayr was heard to say but the landscape has now changed.
1	congratulation England for Brexit, well done Johnson:)
1	It's only as people are non believers.what will they say when Britain gets better
1	I totally agree with the comments made by the PM and fully support his stance. The EU must never ever be able to rule the UK again whatever the cost. UK will not be over-ruled by this bunch. You want a fight then you can have it. Be carefull what you wish for.
0	No, not the English ,please BUT ,THE ARABS,THE TURKS ,THE INDIANS ,THE PAKISTANS ,THE ROMA-INDIANS ,THE AFRICANS and all of the Asians ,AFRICANS and other NOT-EUROPEANS should leave Europe and go back to dwell in their own homenland and their own continents
1	The EU, in its current form, is unsustainable.  It WILL collapse. Brits  were smart to want out. But I fear the powers that be are desperate to  hold their power.
1	Congrats From Belgium, you made the right choice
1	The Socialists are getting scared.   Revolutions are contagious!
0	Seems to me the UK should join some sort of European union
0	HAHAHAHAHAHAH, GET IN!!!!!!!!! REMAIN IN - WE WON!!!!! Unlucky peasants!!!!!! The dole queue awaits, #refugeeswelcome
1	The German machine will take over the EU when the EU collapses
0	Funny like no one like the brits, not even the people from Wales or Scotland which forms part of the united 'forced' kingdom. Funny no
0	Brexit is gonna be like that game Death Stranding. Can't wait!
1	grats to all my brothers and sisters in the UK.
0	Brexit deals will NOT make up for lost EU business.
1	The Eu is a Trojan horse for the takeover. By his evilness Emperoe palpadean
1	Happy Brexit day 🎉
0	Your ‘democracy’ is mob rule, populism sustained by lies about the European Union, shabby theatrical Gestures, and the pretence of integrity.
0	well done UK Trump's slaves now
0	Something I've learnt through this whole awful process is that I feel more European than British. We'll be back.
0	A nation sleepwalking to the edge of a cliff.
0	I can't believe for over 3 years, I've been waking up every morning as a UK citizen thinking "The far-right are winning. We are so fucked."
1	Good. We are well out of this corrupt, undemocratic, German dominated club! As for Sturgeon, I'm Scottish and she doesn't speak for me.
1	This brought a Prideful tear to my eyes. FREEDOM is ALL.
0	just wait when we do leave properly then the shit will hit the leave mongers faces
0	The only country to impose sanctions on itself happy Brexit
1	The corona virus or leaving the EU. I don't know what is worse
1	The quickest and easiest path is to deregulate as much as possible, and leave everything not explicitly government related to the free market. Two wins: free market will start a boom in the UK, and less for the government to deal with.
0	The idea that European states will make individual concessions to the UK's advantage as they "fight over the scraps" seems to be simply the latest iteration of the "they need us more than we need them" line of argument
0	You can join Putin, Trump, Murdoch, Galloway, Boris, IDS etc. in their celebrations. Divided we fall.
0	This is as stark as it gets so voting Remain is the only option.No time to take risks.
1	The People of the UK Voted Leave - JUST DELIVER
0	Minister for Propaganda Laura Kuenssberg earning her keep, I see.
1	Get it done Boris, your doing great
1	It's a great relief to now watch the building burn from a safe distance and not actually still be trapped inside.
0	We champion freedom - but Brexit will mean the next generation is less free to live, work and love across Europe.
1	the chains are off we are free
1	I was dismayed at how democracy was dismissed as ‘populism’ by the BBC etc.  We should not be afraid of democratic process as people are actually for the most part pretty sensible.  In fact studies have shown that personality disorders such as narcissism are more rife in the political classes and senior business leaders.  Narcissists are attracted to power and people lacking normal compassion will latch onto ideologies.  Therefore, it is imperative that normal people are listened to and would be political dictators controlled.  This is why I support Brexit and I still like Our European neighbours and wish them well.
1	Fingers crossed that we leave the EU in the morning then.
1	Happy to see the UK stick it to the Globalists! About time they started taking their country back
0	It's so funny that many of the Brexit voters were running to get residency in the EU before Brexit. It's like they don't understand laws can be changed to send them back to the island
0	Together we stand. Divided we fall - Pink Floyd, 1979.
1	That's bullshit. You don't get a redo when you lose a vote because you cried about it. That sets a ridiculous precedent where anybody can insist on a new vote on anything to "make sure the people haven't changed their minds".
1	We can make seperate deals around the world as long as the EU agrees with them and they are not better than current EU deals.
0	Brexit supposed to be back control, but in reality Boris Brexit looks " losing control. Lol
1	Goid luck with it all I voted leave and leave we are
1	Good for you Brits! Another strike against the globalist mob trying to dictate how you run your country as they rob you blind. Next beer is in your honor
0	The EU will decide whether we will have a deal or not.
1	The UK was forced into the EU because kiddie fiddling Ted Heath was being blackmailed!! Ted Heath betrayed the British people because he couldn't keep 'it' in his trousers!
0	Or they know how fruitless going against the establishment is. The UK is not free. things are probably going to get really bad for the UK soon. The elite will not let the UK go this easy. The EU controls Europe. The UK made a big mistake.
0	He says he will strengthen the country - that's the idea so him the chance to try.
1	Low paid work positions will become less competitive and possibly higher paid.
1	EU HANDS OFF OUR UK FORCES.
1	The only real solution to the 'eu problem' is to announce we will move to WTO with immediate effect. Then once we have the eu's attention- THEN we can start negotiating. The eu really believed that Brexit would have been cancelled by now- they even told us they were ready for Brexit 6 months ago.
0	Bigotry and faux victimhood always need a scapegoat
0	When your country goes right. it goes right into the trash can.
0	Blimey, who are the Brexiteers gonna blame when it all goes wrong....not the EU surely! Hope it all goes well and when do we start getting the £350 million a week! 👍😊
1	Because fuck your original vote! Now on, let’s do all votes after sufficient propaganda.
1	I hope that my loved Italy goes whit brexit and let the europe union tho eat erself. O come diciamo in Italia = VAFFANCULO
1	I'll be dead, but I know that my children and their children...they will be British, independent - and it's a new era for them.
1	Looks like UK and USA are both winning Nigel! Congratulations to you on full Brexit!
1	Same problem here. People and politicians refusing to respect and OBEY the will/vote of the people. THAT'S WHY WE VOTE!!!  A GREAT DAY FOR THE UK and AMERICA. Trump acquitted soon. Victory to the people.
0	so now wishful thinking lies and guesses have to face the harsh economic realities of being outside the free trade area and now you are in big trouble as there are zero economic benefits as in now the only question is how big will the UK's decline be
0	I am incredibly sorry to see the UK leave. I think it is a huge, idiotic mistake that will benefit no one.
0	Into the valley of economic suicide rode the Light in the Head Brexit Brigade!
0	The legal equivalent of unbaking bread.
1	Brilliant Boris, all this under funding etc has been while we have been in Europe, we have given them a fair chance to help us but we don't prosper under EU Influence, we are an island that is bigger than just its size ,leave now,make us GREAT Britain
1	Congratulations to all my friends in the United Kingdom.
1	The EU want us still to remain under their control. Forget it , we are off
1	Down with globalist entities that allow the mega corporations to thrive
1	Interesting how not 1 of them mentioned any single specific thing the EU has done for the citizens of the EU states.
1	Get those rubbish eu flags turned into bin liners
1	"NISSAN TO QUIT THE EU AND INVEST IN THE UK!" So much for the Project Fear scaremongers. This is the exact opposite of their Remainer lies, their hate propaganda is unravelling by the day.
0	the british not wise at all.
0	Seems Brexit happening tonight is going to be the political version of the anti-climax when people ask you on your birthday "do you feel older/different?!?" Nope, just same old rubbish really.
0	I'm not going to mourn #BrexitDay, nor celebrate. I'm feeling defiant & determined, so will be wearing the boots which I created for the anti-Brexit protests!
0	As a European I am happy to see GB go.
1	I think if the majority voted for it then they must’ve had a reason. I wish them the best in whatever comes next.
0	The EU is being scapegoated for British problems and the fallout of the banking crisis & the poor have bought it hook line & sinker. The tragedy is going to be that if we Leave the poor will be hit the hardest and disenfranchised even more. Britain is a mess.
1	Yes Brexit.
1	Brexit: Making Britain great again!
1	The European Union is OUT !
0	Well I was wrong. Can’t believe we rounded up all the foreigners and shot them, they’re having to print £500 notes and I starved to death yesterday like everyone else.
0	the UK are seriously going to regret it
0	#LiarJohnson doesn’t want to refer to the “controversy” by its name any longer. I have news for you  @BorisJohnson . You’re deluded if you think for one second that we won’t hold you and your #Brexit catastrophe to account, constantly, until it is reversed. #ReleaseTheRussiaReport.
0	I think getting leaving the EU is a bad idea. It also means less control, not more. All this is without mentioning the havoc that would ensue if, as the prime minister has threatened, we crash out of the EU without a deal as the prime minister has threatened.
0	A truly sad step for once-great Britain.
1	If anyone ever asks you why you supported Brexit, just ask them who they voted for as their European Commissioner.
0	No matter how much you whinge & chunter remainers your cause is very much lost. Now suck it up & accept reality, you will feel better I'm sure!
0	Brexit means taking back control over borders and currency. It's very U.K.-centric
0	I still can't take Brexit seriously. It's too stupid.
0	It is not something to celebrate
0	Uh oh!! And now reality sets in. Good luck UK!
1	Proving Labour’s ProBrexit credentials. I live in a Tory constituency that’s always been blue. I always vote Libdems. I don’t think “oh no the Tories are going to win anyway so I’ll vote Tory too”... if only Remainers - regardless of FPTP had been true to their Remain values
0	This video is completely ridiculous. The Eu has more benefits and we should definitely stay
0	Let’s not do Brexit, and then we can save money and spend it on the things that matter.
0	'we will be able to do what we want' - something tells me that won't be the case
1	I pray Brexit will deal a huge blow to the EU and to all the globalists who own it! May God bless Mr Boris and Mr Nigel....for turning Britain away from the jaws of EU..
1	If Scotland leaves they wont be able to join the EU. They will be a bankrupt nation and an unstable nation wont be allowed to rejoin
0	@David_Cameron since you instigated the farce that is #Brexit there has been a sharp rise in racist attacks in the UK specifically against EU nationals, my partner being one of them. Under the #Conservative government hate crimes are at their highest and poverty has spread
1	The side with the fewest seats still turn up and represent their constituents. All are represented in a true democracy.
0	Never mind historians, none of us believe the sheer ignorance of Brexit supporters.
1	Have faith in God and He will make Brexit a success for the UK that's a clear message Britain should take a closer look :=).
0	Please, please, please, do hold your breath until the UK rejoins.
0	UK is better off starting preparations to rejoin the EU.
1	I love Britain and desperate to save it for my future generation by leaving EU.
1	we the democratic people of the UK are behind Boris Johnson but we are only 83%
1	All national trade/collective negotiators will look for the best deal possible for their people. As for leverage, the UK are in trouble!
1	Ok, got Brexit done. Soon we take back control!
0	Boris Johnson & the Tories appear to be in the process of ruining our country and economy and continuing to pretend that there will be no problems with Brexit and our country will do wonderfully well outside the EU! Johnson is pursuing a very hard or perhaps even a disastrous No Deal Brexit and this will have major negative consequences for our economy, public services, livelihoods, security etc!
0	Morons! How can they make a deal without adhering to the rules? I’m sick of this imperial arrogance from our Government.
1	As our friends in Europe witness the Brexit house price boom and as the EU economy tanks,
0	Today Brexit... and tomorrow everyone will still be shopping in Lidl & Aldi.
1	At last we can rule our own country & make our own decisions. I've waited over 20 years for this!
1	Did you notice the long faces at the "unbiased" BBC?
1	Europe is great for lots of things but the UK doesn't fit in. It never has
1	So proud of you Brits for recognizing the importance of being British. Despite what the left wants everyone to believe, I know it has nothing to do with racism and everything to do with governing yourselves and retaining your incredible history and culture. We'll be watching closely as you transition back to being you. God bless you and your country!!!!!
0	This government is about to do what no British government has ever done in history, to destroy Britain! Demand Ref2. Stop Brexit!
1	So, now the UK has the per capita GDP of Norway and the industrial power of China.
1	I am afraid it is not that simple.  For many Remainers, it is axiomatic that Brexit will be a disaster.  They are not 80% sure it will be a disaster, or 90% sure, but 100% sure.  Such Remainers will be talking Britain down for years into the future.  Now they may be right - personally, I am 80% sure Britain will be better off with Brexit, on a five-year time frame.  What I believe will happen is that the EU will start crashing in the next 1 to 10 years.  The next recession might do it, or it might be the changing dynamic, now that France and Germany are lead nations.  I suspect that the French now recognize that expansion eastwards was a mistake - I would say probably a fatal mistake - but holding up Albania and Northern Macedonia's entry is too little too late.  But it is only when Europe crashes that Remainers might accept that the UK got it right - and even then, perfidious Albion is likely to be blamed for undermining the wonderful experiment.
0	Some of us know who exploits us already. It isn't the EU.
1	About time. The UK doesnt need to be bound up with the rest of Europe. They are doing fine and are one of the most sought after countries in Europe for job seekers....you don't see mass immigration of Brits to elsewhere....
0	It is a national tragedy that today the UK will leave the EU. I oppose it today for the same reasons I have always opposed it. Brexit is a con. A trick. A swindle. A fraud
0	This is the end of the United Kingdom. Scotland and perhaps Wales will go their own way, and Ireland will finally be united. Cameron, May, and Johnson will have brought on what Napoleon and Hitler never could accomplish. At least you will still be able to get to Ireland from France, without passing through England. How long will it be before the little England folks flood the channel tunnel?
0	Brexit is a death spiral led by people so deluded they behave like extremists. A rational government would have done the risk analysis before triggering Article 50 and concluded that a soft Brexit, Norway model would have been the sensible course to take.  I can't face a life supporting a country that has elected to get poorer over the next decade. I don't want to have children growing up and paying for Brexiteers mistakes.  I think we should all think very seriously about getting out while we can.
0	The bigoted thick racists won, doesn’t say much for the losers does it.
1	Move on UK. Get rid of EU coddler coddler of criminals granted asylum. Amsterdam should cut the umbellical cord of Joma Sison!
1	Personally, as a true liberal, I voted leave because I believe a smaller governing body is better for the people as they are more effective for the smaller amount of people they serve
0	People in UK don't understand that history, imperialism and colonialism is dead, now there are global emergent forces in Asia, Africa and South America. There is not future for UK.
0	Well organized and funded by the globalists.
0	All BS fascism, has got the world in its pocket; we are just pawns, fighting each other. We live as brothers or die as fools.
0	That Brexit has now happened is almost certainly a direct consequence of that 2 years of populist intimidation. Brexit...
1	Britain is only the first in a row, more countries will follow soon. eussr is crumbling, the "superstate" was just a "historical" accident ...
1	Farage is the man
0	Left the EU lol Britain will have a Brexit without an exit as planned.
1	Sad day for europe, I did not want the UK to leave(am from GER)
0	So sad today, this is a huge mistake. Sorry Europe.
1	Breaking up the nation states sounds like a grand idea, but the alternative that presents itself, global governance, seems much, much worse.
1	CONGRATULATIONS To the British for regaining their FREEDOM !! No matter what the cost, a little or a lot, you will never regret this day. AMERICA IS WITH YOU !!!
1	If they start building a wall in ireland things will get nasty
1	Remember President Trump made all of this Possible God Bless the people of the UK Great see you got your country back
1	So Bye, Bye made the Globalist cry, Brussels was a Hustle so we said goodbye; Those good ol' Europeans were crying asking why, Singing this'll be how the EU dies, this'll be how the EU dies;
1	The EU has flawed with the implementation of a worrying amount of legislation
1	Make England Great Again. Kick The filthy letterboxes out!
1	I don't know why I'm happy but I am
0	Brexit day. A sad day in UK history. #leavealighton #LookAfterOurStar
1	It was refreshing to see Scotland, Wales and Ireland’s flags in Parliament square instead of that vile EU dictatorship flag...
0	The EU won't even blink. We've always had it good with them because we were a member. Now we are a competitor they have no reason to give us anything. All this huff and puff from our governent won't make up for the fact that the EU have a much stronger hand than ours. Any short term damage done to their massive economy will be offset by their aim to take business from the UK.
0	The ones that are not celebrating are the ones being paid by the central bank they know it will be gone soon
1	British banks like european banks are in huge distress.
1	I think the decision will be made around July. I don't think it will go the distance if the EU continue to act as children. Too many jobs are dependent on the EU member state's biggest single market - the UK. The 27 will be experiencing a lot of pressure from their businesses to get a deal done.
1	There never was supposed to be a deal we voted out that’s democracy
1	The EU has always been an experiment from day one and there were concerns even from the point of before we entered that it wasn't necessarily the best deal for Britain at the time.
1	Finally, all countries should leave the EU
1	Whoop! We left... Oh yeaaaaaaa! Definitely was an out from me, and I'm young before people blame it all on the older generation
1	SO NOW THEY SING CHRISITIAN SONG WHEN THE CAMERA ARE ROLLINGfake people  in european parlament.
1	I shall never forgive any of the major Remainers.
0	It will be a unattractive and small island since there is a exodo of EU and foreigners companies that will not like to pay tariffs and the complete loss of EU subsidies to the UK universities that became less attractive for investigation and development .
0	Well since we 'have all the cards' as the brexiters kept telling us, I expect the EU to fold completely in the face or our overwhelming advantages and give us everything we want........right?
1	Finally the Brits have reclaimed their sovereignty and security from the EU bullies in Brussels.
1	NO DEAL - YES! None of our taxpayers money for the EU!
1	I'm voting Leave. I have campaigned for it and have appeared on the BBC as  an invited panellist for sunday politics. I'm also a uni student up  north.   Why Leave? well, if this were a simple economic question i'd be  remain. If the commission was really under the agenda set by our elected  governments with oversight by a truly 'proportional' EP and council of  ministers who did have genuine authority and power then I might be  tempted to put up with it. But as it is, and as it looks like it is  going, there are issues concerning the question of who governs? As long  as it remains the fact that we have a situation where parliament is not  the ultimate authority in regards to the laws by which we live then  Leaving is justified regardless. There are plenty of examples of how the  current, past and probable future behaviour and conduct of the various  arms and institutions of the EU project. In 2009 the European Council -  the heads of the elected governments (later excusing Mario Monti and  Italy) - asked the Commission to consider internal austerity, i.e.  cutting their own wages given the member states were themselves under  fiscal pressure, the Commissioners (surprise surprise) didn't like this  suggestion and took the Council to the ECJ. The ECJ found in favour of  the commission, given the fact that if the wages of the commission were  to come under scrutiny then logically the wages of other EU and  Brussels-related institutions would be next.   Powell and the Spectator were right in 1975 when they said (and even  as Heath would admit) the future of the EEC was political. We keep being  told about the uncertainty of Leaving, and I agree there will be huge  challenges, but the future of the EU in uncertain and the EZ more so.
1	EU is a sinking boat. It's clever to leave.
0	Brexit could be the beginning of the end.
1	Freedom is what it's about. F the EU.
0	How childish and moronic. This entitled group of narcisists have been paid handsomely in an expectation that they are capable of respect for the institution and display adult behaviour and the competence required . I however have the greatest respect for the European Parliament and will continue to do so.
0	The right want defend it because they see it as being anti Brexit The left won’t because they see it as being anti Corbyn and pro Tory The middle might just be the only ones who object
1	I think De Gaulle was right when he did not allow Britain to be a member of the EEC.
1	The EU flag revolts me. I feel the same way about the Nazi flag and the Soviet banner with hammer and sickle. All these flags proclaim tyranny.
0	Still waiting to hear what the actual benefits are of leaving the EU. No one has actually managed to give any yet, all I seem to hear is some rhetoric, annecdotes and made up facts like "we get our government back from Germany" and other hilariously stupid comments
1	Cheaper to train UK residents
1	They are finally independent
1	Even your own Darth Vader Mandelson said you blew it Remainers - you say you're the bright ones but missed two open goals to stop Brexit
0	It’s a ploy, a very stupid ploy, but what can you expect from a government of lazy know nothing incompetents.
0	I was opposed to Brexit and my reasons for that are still there. Our exit has happened and I agree that we must now make the best of a bad job. Realism. But Mr Johnson should stop relying on windy rhetoric and make the best of it - realism.
0	"Could" make prices up? Of course it will! Get ready to pay 10 pounds for a bunch of strawberries people.
0	Are the English seeking to become a part of the U.S.? Are they willing to drop the monarchy? Why are U.S. flags flying lower than British flags? It seems they fell victim to the same thing the u.s. did. Unaddressed problems solved with the worst possible solution. We have trump, they have those other dumbasses. The Daily Show made a joke, if this were a movie it would be obvious. Those dudes with crazy hair are aliens and are trying to mess you up. Interesting times.
0	I have not been following this very closely, as we have so many problems here at home. Just seems to me though that this is not a really great idea. Boris Johnson appears to be cut from the same cloth as Donnie Trump and that is not a compliment. Go ahead! Make your comments! I admit I'm not that well informed!
0	Johnson and the Brexiters hoping the country can come together to make Brexit a success. Hahaha, 50+ per cent of the population, mostly the educated ones, want nothing to do with it. Brexit is a Tory project, you own it.
1	Good, we must NEVER take their rules again and absolutely not allow their kangaroo court to impose their verdicts upon us again.
1	I don't subscribe to conspiracy theories as a rule but I find the media terror campaigns over Brexit highly suspicious. I have found it hard to ignore how the media tends to make such a fuss when they have an agenda and those agendas have virtually never been in the interest of the majority . The UK did the right thing leaving Brexit
0	Ok great i can't wait when Ireland an Scotland will make a divorce and split from UK
0	Hope the Brits stocked up on toilet paper.
1	"It's hard to avoid the conclusion that this country is sort of falling apart"...correct, and it's fallen apart on the EU's watch. Time for a change.
1	The British finally stood up against forced immigration and loss of their independence!! GO ENGLAND, screw the rest of the duck marching EU!!!
1	Harder times for the EU having to survive on 8 Billion euros less that the UK currently contributes to their budget
0	Only 47% of the voting population voted to leave in the Advisory referendum. Not the will of the people. Now we will uncover the lies of the Leave Campaign. God help our United Kingdom
1	I will await today's excuse as to why remainers' promises did not come true
0	Voting remain, it's pretty like that if with leave, Scotland will want independence in order to be in the EU. This will result in a constant Tory government as Scotland's vote for Labour is vital in preventing the Conservatives (as can be seen in the last election). Being from the North, that idea terrifies me
1	I think the remainers, and EU lovers just using scare tactics. I have full faith in Brexit and we all need to unite as one and build a better future for are country.
0	I just watched Barnier and he didn't demand anything, he said it is up to the UK to decide what it wants to do. Rubbish inflammatory Mail headline and the mug Brexiteers fell for it yet again
1	Well, well, well......?????? Hahahahaha - what will the remoaners say now!!!?????
1	2 years too late!
1	Now just work hard and hard enough to prove that brexit is only the right option!!!!
0	The majority opinion doesn't make it right, it never did and never will.
0	There are no benefits of leaving the EU without a deal.
0	I would like to thank and congratulate my fellow remainers for behaving in such a tolerant, respectful and responsible way tonite. We've endured much provocation, but our dignified response will always be admired by the more neutral of observers among us. Ultimately, we can feel confident the facts and evidence will reverse this tragic mistake in the next few years. Until then, let the Brexiteers continue burying themselves.
1	The trade deal they can get with the United States will benefit the UK BIGGLEY!!! Well done Brits!!! And congratulations.
0	Now, more than ever is not the time to withdraw from our neighbours. The consequences, particularly for those least able to withstand them will be undoubtedly negative. Don't let the likes of Johnson, Gove and the vile Farage persuade you otherwise. Our membership of the EU is something to be proud of, we can't turn the clock back and the future of the UK is far better served by remaining in. Voting leave will undoubtedly unleash forces and attitudes that have no place in a civilised society, one of the prime reasons for the formation of the EU in the first place.
0	Just thick. Pointless them having a vote I'm afraid. Everyone who votes should be made to do an intelligence test.
0	When We together we are Stronger, when we divided we are weaker.
0	Europeans now look at the EU like a sort of monstruos empire ruled by Germany(and they are not so wrong). To me, a European Union without UK is meaningless, I don’t want a sort of continental revival of the Holy Roman Empire
0	So long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, goodnight We'd like to stay, but we've been taken over by the far right ... So long, farewell, au revoir, auf wiedersehen #WeLoveEU #Brexit
0	Hardcore Brexiters will never be happy. They have Johnson in No 10, Trump in the White House, the UK is leaving the EU by law ... and they're still whining and complaining. Currently about a bell. They will never stop whining and complaining and playing the victim card. It's just who they are.
1	Join us in our new found independence
0	The UK will have to compete one on one with every other country in the world.
0	Why temporary dropping out of the ECHR and a no- deal brexit are all bollocks Johnson will have a very nasty collision
1	the thing that MEPs are realy angry about is the loss of the EU gravy train. £150,000 a year salary, + expenses + plus the index Linked pension , early retirement and all the blind respect that goes with it and the POWER! oh and the chauffeur driven cars and the endless social functions and parties, believing that they are Europes political political elite!
0	Very sad, I hope we can all strive forward and that England does not become a poor country as it was before we joined the European union I have made some great friends from Europe
0	I am growing suspicious of Brexit. They are separating from EU and creating more integrated ties with the US..This might prove to be a mistake.. The NIH might become subject to Big Pharma and the health insurers desire to privatize through subversion.. Someone please dissuade me of these thoughts.
1	A good day for Britain soon they'll reemerge as a top global leader instead of 7th down the list. America needs them to be back on their game but not on Huawei...
0	Look at the theatre in the US senate folks. Do you really wish to turn your back on a more civilised, savvy and sophisticated Europe in favour of these alien people whose only connection with you is their language?
1	It is not surprising that the unelected bureaucrats of the EU have not thought this through and what will happen when their fascist bullying leads to trade under WTO terms.  Before our homegrown Remtards throw a track may I suggest they research what the tariffs are when goods are imported into the EU under WTO and where does the money go.  Now apply those rules to EU27 goods imported to the UK and see where the money goes. KERCHING!!
1	The EU needs a drastic change of attitude if it wants a deal with Great Britain.
1	Does he really lack support for this people Boris Johnson's push to diverge from EU regulations lacks public support
0	Brexit good for the EU? Right, sure, say what you like
1	What gets seldom said is that this is actually the best thing that could happen to the EU. The UK never belonged there. It was thwarting, sabotaging and leading the EU the wrong way. No, the agent of transatlantic dominion has been removed. That's good.
1	Congratulations to all of my friends in the UK.  Now you will be able control your own destiny and deside who immigrates into your country and why !
1	The EU is like one's divorced wife, who still wants to use one's car, dip into one's bank account, tell one who one can and cannot meet and so on. BoJo is correct for once, you have to be mad to accept such a deal, it's like being in the EU in all but name.
1	Hopefully more countries will follow.
1	Thanks for the celebration Nigel. If it wasn't for him, we would never have got to celebrate our independence, we never would have left. Arise Sir Nigel. A true hero.
1	After the #googletax deal, we need to restore faith in our tax system @johnmcdonnellMP #bbcqt
1	Macron's country erupts into mass violence every weekend. Who's he to go criticising? Lol
1	I voted for Brexit. What it is with me, I’d rather be a poor master than a rich servant. “It wasn’t about the racism, immigrants or anything, it was about freedom.
1	Everyone should leave the European Union. After all, its nothing but a useless union serving no ones interests
0	The people have made themselves heard. Had they actually felt listened to in years leading up to this then this result would be different.  The Guardian should be demonising the legions of elitist pricks who kept patting everyone else on the head and telling them to shut up and go away. That of course, and maybe especially, includes the Guardian.
0	England will have no place to trade and lose a lot
0	Gove and Johnson look like they have just inherited a sick pet from a great aunt that have won a referendum...anyway, brexiters will be disappointed in 2 years time when they realise that we are still in the EU and Art. 50 never gets invoked....not a single PM will do that and risk going down in history as the PM that took the U out of the UK forever
0	I’m sorry for my british friends, but I really hope UK doesn’t get his way in the trade talks. The more UK suffers the more people will realise that globalisation, free trade and unity are essential for investment, jobs and prosperity
1	You're the man Mr. Farage.
1	wow britan is on the right path so fix themselves up!
0	The decision to put it to a vote was a monumentally terrible decision, done as pure posturing because everyone expected the vote to fail. It was wrong to put it to a vote, and I'd argue the best course of action to stay in the EU notwithstanding the vote. I don't even support a second referendum because that just legitimizes the idea that such a thing even should be left to the masses. We have professionals running the government for a reason. The masses are asses.
1	It's funny that they talk like EU came before Britain.
1	We will spread hope and opportunity to every part of the UK
1	Today I walked past a house that had an EU poster in the window. I smiled, that is all. Yet the homeowner opened his door and hurled abuse at me! These people are flipping bonkers.
0	This has to STOP! In the event of #NoDeal, the surest thing to do is to withdraw #Article50. This must be a priority consideration for UK Parliament, who are bound to place our national security above all else.
1	Brexit is the first step to save Europe from the EU.
0	it sounds like a mess that they're going along with anyway because of the "sunk cost" thing. Really dumb.
0	Why are remainers so bothered about no deal brexit? Let those who voted for it suffer the ensuing economic hardship. They said they’d had enough of experts anyway.
0	Brexit was and is on Putin's agenda.  Stop it NOW.
0	I voted remain, lost, accepted it. I’m no remoaner, no one likes a sore loser so get over it or move to Europe. Simple as
0	Brexit, how could a country be so stupid. Leaving a group of equals to become a poodle for Trump.
1	the UK has been in river of EU crap since 1973 ,, There was a saying,,,, I will share it with you ,THERE WAS NOTHING LIKE GOOD OLD FASHION BRITISH ENGINEERING ,, What do we make now, where is our industry ,,,,,,,GONE well most of it
1	The Sun says remoaners should stop spewing their hate, what's this litany of garbage from Kavanaugh the American stooge then if not hate?
0	It would be an unmitigated disaster to leave.
1	We are watching history unfold good job UK.
1	It's good we've gone, but we'll never know the good deal we could already have concluded if it hadn't been for all the remainiac traitors working on behalf of the EU al this time - [and I am including Theresa May in that] - one of the might have beens of history.
0	HOW DO YOU STOP A FUTURE TERRORIST WHEN THE ONLY EVIDENCE IS A THOUGHT?
1	Congratulations from Slovakia and now SKexit
1	Who does he think he is? Our waters, our fish! If you want our fish, buy them from us
0	No Brexit or no deal exit were the only two options. Great use of tax payers money. Slow clap.
0	This comment is the text version of a small child holding a boot against their own head. You're going to be affected by the EU, but now you won't have any say in it. So push that boot harder, I guess.
0	Its going to be like a Divorced couple living in the same house.
0	Sometimes I wonder what bullshit UKIP is even feeding you Anglos for you to actually believe leaving is a great idea in the first place.
0	They have only just left after listening to it for years so let’s not start another few years of counting down their rejoining.
0	At last we have left! Now the deluded brexiteers will finally have to wake up and experience reality.
1	Stick to your guns Boris, stick to your guns.
0	Leavers? Let them eat cake.
0	Don’t be so ridiculous, pat, this is the ugly face of Brexit - it is a philosophy propounded by many far right groups which can lead to attacks on immigrants.
0	Yes we could leave but how much better would it be if our politians both national and European worked a lot harder to promote a vision for Europe rather being constrained the dismally shallow views of the economists. Europe should be so much greater than the sum of its parts. It’s a shame that some of its parts are heading towards nationalism and irrelevance.
1	We joined a common market and now left behind the EU which has morphed into something we donâ€™t want to be part of. Freedom starts from today; our own rules and we can trade internationally.
0	Question "What exactly are these benefits the working class family will get leaving the EU? Typical Brexiter answer "Shut up remoaner, you lost"
0	Those willing to give up freedom for security deserve neither.
0	A hot mess.
1	Why not let Nigel do the trade dealing with the EU, he has more experience and will not be fobbed off. Nigel has done more for our country then any Politician since Churchill, so why isn't he in our government.
0	These are the lying Facebook ads Dominic Cummings used in 2016. Why is no newspaper RIPPING APART the lies
0	I was so thrilled that we won … I actually believed Theresa May when she said Brexit means Brexit — very stupidly of me — and I think I gave the impression that I rather walked away. I’m not going to walk away this time
1	U.K. was a lot way better before they joined the EU globalist
1	I feel such pride that we are now an independent country again. We will flourish!
0	I'm so angry if 'Leave' wins! Leaving the EU will ruin our economy and have more severe long-term repercussions. Pathetic, absolutely pathetic
0	Remain. Here in NI we are pretty reliant on grants from the EU. Farming is one  of the main industries and about half of a farmers income comes directly  from the EU. Invest NI, which financially supports a huge number of the  bigger employers gets most of their money from the EU.   I'm sure it's the same in Scotland and north England. The UK gov only  cares about London. If they were in charge itd be a much worse place.   This is all without mentioning that Northern Ireland has a physical  border with the EU (Ireland) which none of those leave bastards have  even tried to address.
1	Say goodbye to croissants, people. Delicious croissants. We're stuck with crumpets FOREVER.
0	Welp, It's time to get back into the Apocalypse Shelter
1	This is a glorious speech! I am so happy for the people of the United Kingdom! You're free again!
1	Tonight the silent majority celebrate - we have kept our powder dry for 3 years now, whilst every insult has been hurled at us by the so called elites, champagne socialists and the establishment traitors.
1	Happy Brexit day to all, may we forge a bright and prosperous future free from the shackles of the EU.
1	A big thanks to Jeremy Corbyn the person that did the most to get people to vote for leave and Boris.
0	Brexit is a negative, retrograde and destructive act.
0	Brexit = Stupidity
1	Thankfully, there is still freedom of speech and advertising rules so we are live on location.
0	Division is anti progress.
1	Time to walk away and start trading with the rest of the World ! WTO !!!!
0	4 days after #brexit Chris openly admits if I am a tourist I CAN speak Polish to my mama in the street but since I've worked almost 15 years for him and his country it bothers him. How am I supposed to feel like at home now when millions of Chrises want me to leave or shut up!??
1	Never felt prouder to be British.
0	This isn’t a celebration about leaving it’s a celebration of it finally being over.... now we can get screwed over
1	Good, now get us out of the EU.
1	I can honestly say that so far I have been hugely impressed with Boris and his approach to Brexit.
1	it will be THE first to leave the e.u. but I bet it won't be THE last
1	Watch the EU begin to crumble now.
1	Way to go Nigel. Way to go Boris.
0	But for the majority, it's a moment of despair. But we will rejoin - probably sooner than you think.
0	Britain economy will end up like Britain car industry :/
0	What an infinitely sad, painful and unnecessary goodbye to our British friends. Europe will miss you dearly, I will miss you dearly.
1	There will be no endless delay of respecting people's will. They did not vote for a dealed Brexit, but simply to get of of the EU. The parliament has had two years for the procedure. Now it's enough!
0	The future is certain: it’s awful
0	Congratulations, you guys finally decided you didn’t want to slaves after all. Now, let’s see the lion roar.
0	Moving to the EU is an option or failing that suicide
1	This country belongs to the crown,
1	So here we go again what a great idea Tariffs on both sites and the consumers or people pay again wow what a great EU or actually Establishment we I say Europe on paper sound great oh wait don’t forget to read the Small print they are so pissed about Brexit they like to give a nice punishment whatever I like to go back in time and tell all 28 members to not go together before I need to repeat this again well I think the Swiss was the smartest never go in the first place well we see in 11 months how this will end  I hopes in favor of Great Britain 🇬🇧
0	Just watched John McDonnell's interview on Marr this morning. I agree with him completely that the idea that Tony Benn would have supported Brexit is fallacious. Benn was a rational and intelligent man. And he was also a principled anti-racist. #BrexitDay
0	We've had 70 years of peace but look around there's lots of other things that are not peace so I hope you break that down in this video
0	As an American, the UK leaving the EU has always struck me as stupid and odd because it would be like Michigan trying to leave the United States economy. Why would Michigan ever think that's a good idea for them to cordon themselves off from the rest of the U.S., all in the name of keeping out people from Minnesota and Indiana? Strange and futile, indeed.
1	We were offered a gold proof Brexit 50p today, by and expectant profiteering brexiter.
0	So, just in the last 2 days he bans his aids from saying "No deal", tries to avoid any scrutiny from the press, and now he has a code for No Deal in order to discombobulate the masses again into thinking it’s not the dreaded "no deal" which would do trade no end of harm. What a lying deceitful charlatan winker
0	The only thing I can see that we get leaving the EU is French printed blue passports.  Everything, and I mean everything that was promised has been proved to be at worst a lie at best a mistake.  We have a withdrawal agreement that Theresa May threw out and we have a border in the Irish sea, that our prime minister Boris Johnson swore would not happen.  Big whoop!
0	Indeed! Only a fool believes everything they read in the newspaper. Especially if that newspaper is the Mail, Telegraph, Sun or Express - all Tory rags pedalling fake news to the masses!
0	The costs of Brexit are all down to remainers      David Davis was in charge of the first negotiation - a brexiter!    Then Raabid Dominic, then Stephen Barclay.   Brexit has been run by Brexiters all along and it’s Brexit that burns the black hole in our economy.
1	CONGRATS TO OUR MATES ACROSS THE POND!!GOD BLESS!!!! THIS IS WHAT THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE LOOKS LIKE!! FREEDOM, LIBERTY, INDEPENDENCE & SOVEREIGNTY BE YOURS....FOREVER!!
0	I feel bad for Scotland. They should be allowed to separate from the UK. It doesn't make sense. An article said Scotland can't be separated, because they share land on the island. Ok, but what does that have to do with it? If you look at any large body of land (Europe for example), they all share the large body of land, but it is separated by country.
1	Boris is a boss. The British will decide who fishes in their waters. Not the EU.
1	If the EU really wants to be a union with its proper government, it should be better off without the UK (now the “divided kingdom”), unless they change their minds.
1	In the early 70's I bought a house just on my one normal wage. I worked a 35hr. week, not one minute more. I brought up my family, had annual holiday, ran a car, on one normal wage, with no debt ever, accept my mortgage. Us workers had strong unions, we had immense power, were treated well, employers had to they needed us, no unlimited cheap foreign labour then. It's been 47yrs of decline for the working man. It's been little by little so most, especially younger people, haven't noticed. I voted Leave FOR young people, so they can have the life I've enjoyed.
1	Only countries that are prepared to grovel and do as they're told are welcome in the EU. Perfect for Krankie.
0	Give it a few months until the consequences of leaving the EU start to sink in.  For example, the British immigrants  living in Europe who voted to end their own freedom of moment, their access to free healthcare and the loss of their pension rights. Being a third country is not going to be a whole heap of fun especially when the expats all start moving back to Blighty!   Where are they all going to live?
1	"How Britain lost Europe " Thats a fairly provocative title, was that on purpose? Haha.  I think if we had seen greater political and economic integration of France and Germany, then the UK may have had more confidence in the future of the EU. However, the EU went the opposite way, and focused on adding more members, failing to reform, and suffering financial and political crises.  I think the truth of it is: the EU lost English people.
0	Sounds like there’s a lot of tension in #UK Gov over budget spending plans.
1	Can laughing at #Brexit bring #Leavers and #Remainers together?
1	get that poor pathetic remainer off deluded we will never rejoin about time saps lie him need to understand its over done and we will never change our minds
0	Wow Respekt
0	Let's be honest for a change.We want our country back is what they really mean a white English speaking soceity.
1	“The EU is enormously powerful.” This is exactly why you leave if you value sovereignty.
1	The Economy of Britain will be 1£
0	European its just good on the paper and when they speak but action are far away of that :) like Farage say : We love europe, we just hate the european union ! <3
1	In the next few decades 5-10 new poorer countries will join, meaning  that millions of poorer people will have the right to freely come to the  UK, putting our population at over 80 million. This is unsustainable  and will put too much pressure on our schools, NHS etc, and will  obviously lead to higher crime rates. So in fact, immigration is a  perfectly valid reason to leave.
0	Doesn’t matter anymore Simon. Brexit is `done’, Johnson has an 80 seat majority.
0	Now bring back normality and stop torturing us with this Tory infighting brexit scam and Revoke Article 50. Business confidence and stability will return  The easiest option is staring them in the face and these Ministers keep on dithering, good to see they are now 'Raising their game' as The Speaker instructed them weeks ago.  Brexit is quite plainly not a desirable option in any format. There is no majority for any of it. We don't want to be hearing daily brexit for years to come. Exit Brexit.
1	britain can do without all the overpriced rubbish on amazon the middleclass like to buy
1	OUTSTANDING! Another direct hit to the global socialists
1	It is stupid to sold out your country to a bunch of Un-Elected politician(EU).
1	This is going to save the UK.  Congratulations.
0	At least Brussels has never taken us to some unjust and illegal wars, or imposed the unfairest tax imaginable!
1	The left are really racking up the losses now....Scottish Indy ref, EU ref, 4 general elections, 2 EU elections.....no but the problem is us we just keep getting the answer wrong!!!
1	I have always said we should walk away and if they want a trade deal they can come to us!
0	So your suggesting we buy more fruit and veg from countries further away just because of leaving the EU, increasing our carbon foot print? Very Eco friendly.
0	Johnson is the fifth horseman of the apocalypse and I hope the others ride off towards hell with him and the other Brexiters in tow, leaving the rest of us in peace.
1	the problem of people coming here and taking our jobs
1	We are 100% better off outside the EU. I am sure Boris will get the best deal he can, but we can help ourselves by buying British and supporting our own farmers and producers.
0	They forgot something essential: British citizens will no longer be EU citizens.
1	This is the perfect opportunity for young people be take on apprenticeship with these companies! Now let’s see all those people walking around saying they took our jobs get jobs, I’ll back it in they don’t.
1	Brexit is the greatest opportunity this country will ever have!
0	Excellent that Brexit is going to 'get done' at 11pm this evening and a new trade deal will definitely in place by December 2020 lol
0	It's disgusting to see that I am from a country that are filled with lunatics. It's a headache
1	I am SO PROUD and SO HAPPY for the British people. They have gone through dark times before, but they always fight their way back.
0	Remaining in the EU is "better for the education system"! Incredible. "I believe the EU can be reformed"! Amazing. A triumph of hope over experience.
0	Nobody tell the Brexiteers that we have 11 months of being absolute rule-takers with no say in said rules before they're able to fully celebrate their "victory"
1	I think the debate is over and Brexit done. We were sold that we could develop better overall trading structure without contributions and reduce immigration without harming economy and could break business free from unnecessary regulation. Tories have huge majority so no excuses not to deliver.
1	you brought seven million in to screw the working class well we screwed you in the end
1	happy Brexit day everybody
0	Brexit Day +4 The grounded planes, the chaos in the streets, the unpaid workers, the crippling strikes
0	This country has improved out of all recognition since joining. It's laughable to say you can't see any advantage.
0	the UK will go back where they came from before they joined the EU:  The bottom of the pile financially. Good luck to them.
1	Congratulations May with the Brexit, it is also your victory.
0	The irony of celebrating brexit with champagne.
1	MAKING BRITAIN GREAT AGAIN
0	Mr Hague, Brexit was and is a terrible idea. We have done it but it remains a terrible idea.
1	Happy independence day everyone
0	Can anyone who voted to leave please explain to me how we are going to get better trade deals with the EU than we have/had.
1	congratulations England for Brexit, well done Johnson:)
1	it’s only a farce because people who voted Remain think they know best and that Leave shouldn’t be an option.
1	Get over it and start building our country up again instead of constantly spreading gloom! We actually managed to live ok before the EU.
0	So that’s a good thing ??
1	WOOP WOOP!!
0	Tomorrow I wake up a year older and no longer an EU citizen. Worst birthday ever.
0	I was in London when it happened. I remember walking around a premiere  European Capital that tangibly felt like less of a European Capital than  it had just a year earlier, and thinking solemnly "These poor bastards.  Glad I live in the good ol' US of A where we would never do something  this stupid."
1	The globalists tried to ignore the will of the people and undo a democratic vote but in the end the people won this round. The fight against globalism is far from over though.
1	Go Brexit
1	Now that Brexit has happened and is reality it's time to realise that it's up to everybody to make success of it. Why do you expect leavers to do all the work while you sit and be a dead weight yourself? Brexiteers did not say for 47 years "well, remainers, it's all up to you, we remain so you prove us it is worth it" so why would you?
1	Rejoice! We are free! Our fisherman can now be free! They can fish for fish like never before. Fuck you EU! Ha...we are going to be a beacon to the world with all our British fish.
1	The EU is an unelected dictatorship!
0	its bad for their national economy and will have socio-economic effects on european union, as a Turkish person i think this is an opportunity for us to get closer with EU but probably not gonna happen with current political leaders
1	Not only the greatest moment in the history of Britain, could be the greatest moment in the history of the world as well
1	No I dont think we are divided in England.Every single region par London voted for Brexit. Every single one. Even labour voters lent their votes to boris in the "red wall". Because like me us English believe passionately in our country and a global Britain we back our fantastic country and will not play any part in a federal commuist state which it clearly is to anyone with an IQ above 50.
1	I hold a rosy view of Britain’s future outside of the EU.
1	Frankly I prefer to be dictated to & ruled over by people of my own country than foreign ones. That's Brexit in a nutshell & why I voted to Leave the EU.
0	This reminds me of a caged animal, afraid to come out when the door is opened
1	Dover and Out !!!
0	Noone mentions the value-loss of the pound in this after Brexit. It drains money out of the economy because speculative bussiness is using the turmoil to gain money by exchanging between currencies.
1	While the UK suffers some of the largest interregional inequalities in the developed world, these might be exacerbated if, as some economists expect, the more prosperous parts of the country prove to be less affected by and/or more resilient to, any economic impacts of Brexit
0	It's a sad result of the bass ackwards right-shifted stab at a new era of Mercantilism.  It should be put to a final public vote, and there should be a stipulation added to article 50 that countries must hold a vote to start article 50, enter a period of structuring where the country in question plans their exit strategy, without allowing any funds to be used for advertising a particular exit strategy. Following the period of deciding the strategy, it should be put under a second public vote to decide whether article 50 will continues or not.   Leaving the EU isn't good for anyone, the best way to increase the standards of living is to unify intent and ideals, not unnecessarily create new divisions that weren't there before.
0	They'll sit back and just let the UK screw itself over and then cave. It's worked so for them so far. They've got everything they've wanted to date and they know Johnson says one thing, swears to do it then caves. They know we've followed the emptiest of people.
0	Brexit is a misguided attempt to turn back the clock to better times. Politicians are just parasites that will go in whatever direction offers them best benefits.
0	I believe that you have been hood winked by a pompous leader who is only interested in profiting the rich but now it's too late for you to change your subordinate minds
0	Welp you guys finally did it. It took you four long years, but you did it.  Now take off your pants and bend over, cause you're about to get economically *fucked*
0	As a British person...... I can say with confidence that I hate British people. I am sorry for all those that have to put up with us Britons
0	This is why education is important!
1	Narsaccist, European expansionist, the European Union is worse than the Soviet Union.
1	E.U. is lost empire full of Ex.USSR,we pay more in for their livelihoods, they are expanding while we contribute to their stability at the expense of our wealth and prosperity. Our benefits reduced, pension ages increased,wages on lifeline.Rich will always survive anywhere
0	FREEEEEEEEEEEDOM!
0	Well I think it's a terrible idea, but...bring it on. I will take my skills abroad, live amongst a less insular culture for a while. When the impoverished UK is desperate for people to come back within 5-10 years, house prices would hopefully have come crashing down somewhere to near a level I can afford. If, not, I'll stay away. Win-win either way for me.
0	I wonder if the UK see the irony in leaving the EU maybe they can see how Ireland wanted to leave the British rule
1	Britain should wait for the EU to come begging to trade as they will on the 11th hr, we need to stand firm we can not give in or be dictated to by the EU, thats why we left so we dont have to follow their rules anymore
0	How dare Farage use Ireland to back up his idiotic notions? How dare he twist my vote in both Lisbon Treaty referendums and why I changed my mind? Am glad Mairead McGuinness cut his diatribe off. Thank goodness he is off to the States. Europe has had enough of his gracelessness, tactlessness and rudeness.
1	Personally I dont want to have anything to do with remainers. I'd like them to leave. I dont consider them as part of our community.
0	Britain will suffer huge economic loss after Brexit.
1	Congratulations couldn't be more proud of the British society we can actually wave our flag without being frowned upon!
0	Brexit is laborious, time consuming and (at times) all consuming.
0	Brexit is developing into a project where there will be unpalatable comprises, painful trade-offs and potentially irresponsible political decisions with profound economic consequences.
1	I don't know where it was or under what laws we weren't allowed to attempt to trade beef or lamb with the United States or China. But there you have it in black and white from the Prime Minister. We were only allowed to trade with the EU and that is why we had to leave, that is the inference of his speech. Now we can once again trade with the rest of the world and I think a market of 6 billion is rather better than a market of 600 million, don't you?
0	OMG! We (the UK) are so f**ked now....
1	Nigel won it fair and square over decades of hard works. Of course the remoaners will never ever appreciate that, they don't know hard works.
0	Leavers will regret their decision whilst remainers will unjustifiably suffer the consequences !
0	How about "Lieing Brexit Bastards, funded by crooked millionaires, supported by old bigots"? How can a democracy remain democratic when it is subverted and traduced by creatures like Cummings and Aaron Banks, and the propaganda trolls of Tufton Street....all Brexit Mongers talking of war.? Liar! Liar!
1	the EU membership is our biggest problem
1	finally, an actual leader who puts our country first.
0	More than likely UK is gonna made suffer and go crawling bck
1	Merkel and Macron says Brexit is a bad idea? Two of the worst leaders in Europe!!
1	I can honestly say that so far I have been hugely impressed with Boris and his approach to Brexit. If he continues on the course he has set he will become a national hero. Boris - we've all put our faith in you, don't let us down!
0	Remain. It would be a disaster for Wales to leave the EU. I am also  invested in the EU project and just don't want to leave anyway, but  logically as a Welshman I cannot vote to leave the EU because I would  literally be voting to cut off a pretty large funding stream to Wales  that would not be replaced by any UK government (changes to the Barnett  formula are hard, and Scotland also doesn't want them sooooo).
1	They big problem is that the EU expanded too far, too soon. This is where the problems with immigration come into play. When it was a smaller union, the MS had similar GDP's. Now that several, relatively poor, Eastern European states have joined, of course there has been mass immigration.
1	Britain should also change it's laws and implement harsher punishments for criminals, something the liberal controlled EU forbade.
0	That woukd be a very short sighted decision. Sure Britain makes a lot if products and had great trade influence but cutting ties with EU would mean some money glow would be redirected away from GB.
0	Nothing to celebrate...only fear and regret.
1	I'm a 24 year old male living in the UK and I would like to think I  don't fall in to the 'sun reading racist' category, I am however planing  on voting to leave. For me it has nothing to do with immigration, it's  more to do with the crippling bureaucracy that comes with the EU. The  best argument I have heard to remain is 'you can't fix it if you aren't  in it' but it seems to me that even with Cameron's best efforts we can't  fix it when we are in it. So that being said we have two options, we  stay in a union we can't fix or we leave and have a go at fixing our  situation on our own.
1	WE ARE EXTREMELY HAPPY TO LEAVE THIS DICTATORSHIP ASAP
0	Britain will think back to join the EU ,but now we consider him as a lost animal
0	I'm really sad to say it , but you really played yourselves, in the most fantastic way. Not even a sci-fi writer could think something like this
1	The UK is leaving the single market, thus full control of immigration, under Boris Johnson, yes!
1	I will be voting leave, The most important issues for me are immigration  and sovereignty so it makes sense for me to vote to leave.  I feel that both sides have been just as bad and have been trying to  scaremonger people into voting for what they want, but this seems to be a  common thing in British politics, a similar sort of "Its the end of the  world!" thing happened when the Scottish referendum was happening.
0	UK seems to be wanting to revive the Empire days. not gonna happen. so what's now - isolated, spent to the outmost when it comes to "being United Kingdom" and with only friend Trump, who is a Laughing stock of the entire world?
0	Finally the wait is over.…
1	I hate how everything is just going to be more expensive now
1	UK finally leaves the EU
0	It’s no wonder Downing Street has told some of these clowns to do one
0	Well, for a start, I would guess that having a divided country is not a good opportunity to change the current system...
1	It's Anglo-Saxon free thinking, common law, a free market economy and a positive outlook for me. EU statism is so miserable, demoralising and inflexible.
1	Good. Best decision the country has made while I've been alive.
1	No more stupid EU laws
0	Britain Will Rule the Waves Again!!
0	We were often described in past times as the "Sick Man of Europe". Well, we’re going to be even sicker if commonsense does not prevail.
0	WELL IS IT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OR TENS OF THOUSANDS? NO MENTION OF TOMMY ROBINSON MARCH. GUESS WE CAN SEE THE GUARDIAN'S AGENDA BIAS.
0	Good on ya UK. Y'all have your own independence day now
0	What had the election of Trump and Brexit in common?  The Mercer family, Cambridge Analytica, all with ties to Russia and Putin.  Putin's plan to bring the Western world to its knees is working just fine.
0	no natural resources, no industry and no more colonies to exploit its devinatively byebye little Britain!!
0	#BorisJohnson will push #UK into financial/economical abyss. By the time #Britain economy is completely broken & #British people totally impoverished, he will be long gone & not in power to be held accountable. That's why #Conservatives can get away with #Brexit.
0	I loved my British Heritage. Now I’m embarrassed that I have such racist countrymen.
0	Dumbest decision in a while by UK officials, damage is already done, everyone is packing or leaving, keep giving British passports and good luck with that Titanic
1	Increase the size of the Navy now, protect our waters as the French and Spanish don't let us fish in theirs. Stuff the EU, Britain comes first.
0	Nearly 50% of population who bothered to vote didn't want Brexit, and 2 countries within the UK voted to remain. Let's hope that sense will prevail and we remain.
0	Congrats Brexiters, you've voted to make the country poorer, voted to drive out business and to leave this age of relative prosperity behind. I hope that blue passport (which you'll never use) will be of some comfort when you find yourself unemployed and struggling to provide for your family.
1	A democratic choice was given and made.
0	Why would anyone chose the UK, there are so many better choices!
1	Excellent I hope that this means that you lot will be replaced by some pro-british journalists and television show Runners maybe we'll actually get decent Doctor Who for a change
0	A reminder to all that Brexit day will be some point in 2021......unless we can still manage to #stopbrexit ? It's a con with no-upsides so maybe when the majority work this out....?
1	The UK has officially left the European Union after 47 years of membership. This historic moment happened at 23.00 GMT on 31st January 2020.
1	First of all, as a European from the mainland I'm glad about Brexit. Finally we got rid of the UK! However, the Scots are always welcome back! As independent Scots, that is.
1	It would be Good if people would just give Boris a chance,  time for whinging is over put your EU flags away and get behind the  majority of the country
1	Marvellous news - democracy at play
0	Why is England working so hard to keep Scotland?
1	Happy Brexit Day🇬🇧
1	Because of Brexit people have been engaged in politics in a way they have not before. Please keep us involved - it is our money being spent - we should have a say on major high cost projects - create a new form of politics by including the people you are working for.
1	I believe that there is potential for things to improve due to Brexit
1	Hip hip hooray for Britain!!
1	READ THE COMMENTS below pro leave and below pro remain videos; you may be interested by the bias. In my research that bias has shown to be overwhelming to leave.
0	I work in the EU, have done for years, i love it's people's, it's culture, it's diversity, food, beer, ladies, I'm more European than ever, tory hatred of the EU has cost us, our rights are going, but our youth will return us in time, I'm celebrating with pals in the EU
1	I am having optimistic beliefs that we will leave on the 31st.
1	Just imagine what the U.K. could and should have been, if she hadn't joined in the first place?
1	I have never had any sort of 2nd thought. I voted out because I am thoroughly sick of the EU - an anti-democratic genocidal construct designed to erase nation states and alter their genetic make-up. When you see people like Blair and Merkel getting the EU's Kalergi prize you know that is true - if you don't know what the Kalergi plan is, look it up.
1	The way the EU works at this point is very undemocratic
1	Every single remainer I’ve seen interviewed has said they’re sad to be leaving Europe. We. Haven’t. Fucking. Left. Europe! Europe is a continent. We can’t leave a land mass!
0	Feeling ashamed and outraged seeing all the narrow minded , racist and nationalist people right now on tv. Having croissants and espresso for breakfast
1	Tally ho, Brits! Once again youse have shown the way to a world choking on collectivism, parochialism, arrogance and protected selfishness. For the second time since 1215 Britain has shown the world how to stand up and fight back.
0	If only they had given Cameron something to bring back to the UK.
1	Take back control.
1	Why should I, as an English man, care what aguments people I've never heard of with names like Juncker or Schulz are making ?
1	What a trooper you are Nigel.Thankyou.
0	We also benefit within the UK from the lower costs for unskilled labour that EU migrants bring.
0	Spot on. It will be a disasterous no deal Brexit come January next year  if the UK government doesn't wake up to reality. The size of their  majority will count for nothing when food and medicine shortages meet  mass redundancies and petrol shortages. The run on the pound will only  make taking on the euro seem so much more sensible when whoever's in  charge finally asks the EU for readmittance.
0	Wasn't this supposed to be the easiest trade deal in history?
0	Say no to xenophobia. Say no to needless economic strife. Say no to blaming the EU for the mess the Tories have made of the NHS, housing and immigration control. Say yes to tolerance. Say yes to the common market, to trade and investment. Say yes to elections deciding the future direction of this country. Vote Remain.
0	The good reasons for having been a member of the EU: free movement, enhanced protection of workers’ rights, strong regulatory standards for foodstuffs, enhanced bargaining power in trade deal negotiations.  These four, powerful concepts spring to mind unbidden. I could probably add another four without a great deal of reflection.  And these are/were actual, substantial benefits that we’re casually discarding as if they have no value.  Good reasons for leaving? Not at all apparent. Apart from windy words and hopeful generalisations from Brexiters no-one - not a single commentator over the past three and a half years has come up with a set of reasons for leaving that stands up to examination.
1	No deal
1	The odds are very poor with the EU's current  leadership and baked in ideology
1	Not even photoshop, i took a picture of my flag and it came out like this.happy brexit day
1	Eu is mafia run club. The sooner uk is out the better
0	so for the next 3 years we are going to be paying billions into the eu, for absolutely nothing. an immediate NO DEAL would have been better.
0	They were told that there would be a bonfire of regulations, and that was seen as a good thing. I could never understand why.
0	Why leave?
0	The only question is, how hard will the UK cry when nothing that got promised happens and it all just gets worse?
0	Maybe French people don t like UK in the EU or they don t care. But I Do, I am Romanian , love UK, speak their language, learned their history, and I Would love to visit freely that country without a visa. Which I may not get, being Romanian, …low class european. Let us be united, at least theoretically, because we know we re not equal, but at least we can travel if we afford it.
0	Brexit is a misguided attempt to turn back the clock to better times. Politicians are just parasites that will go in whatever direction offers them best benefits.
1	As a U.K. citizen Im sick of being shafted by the EU. If they want a level playing field then STOP putting demands on the table before negotiations begin.
0	An Economic crisis is coming home.
0	Brexit = Britain has no leverage in trade negotiations. And will be desperate to sign deals.  US will firmly demand NHS as part of any deal. Our politicians want  your politicians to let our pharma and for-profit health care industries  savage your country and grind every last quid out of the British.  If you think you can't squeeze blood from a stone then you have never dealt with US health care and pharma industry.  I post this everywhere but here goes  My 2020 health insurance plan:  $21,250 annual premium  $5,000 annual deductible  $45,000 max annual out of pocket  If that sounds great then you will love Brexit. If not, you need to figure out how to cancel Brexit.
0	I give it week.... until their economy collapses
0	Brexit was based on fear. Fear of the other. It was not a rational decision but a reactionary one. It was bad for Britain and it is bad for the residents of the Commonwealth. The only beneficiary of the Brexit was Russia.
1	Because fuck the voters right?
1	Correcting a mistake ....... should never joined in the first place.
1	God bless Brexit 😘😘.
1	Why do the media always say “uncertain future?” These are the English! The majority of them have backbones. They’re going to look to the future and their newfound freedom. Good luck to them. KBG Keep Britain Great 🇬🇧 and the USA even greater
1	I'll take the pain if there is any, just to be free from the E.U politicians who ridicule, insult and try controlling this country.
0	Brexit, how could a country be so stupid. Leaving a group of equals to become a poodle for Trump
0	Opportunities you say @BorisJohnson? That's awesome. Tell me more about these opportunities?
1	We need to make a very large deal with America which is mostly in place to get us started then the rest of the commonwealth before the end of the year.Let's get the ball rolling ASAP !
1	love Europe ! Hate the EU !
0	message to the EU from Scotland " We'll be back"
1	Brexit, the biggest con in a century.
1	ust to clarify my perspective, some of you have interpretted my comment and come to the conclusion that the reason i wanted to leave the EU was so that we could become some deregulated wild west, where my actual belief is that the people who are most capable of putting in place effective legislation in the UK is the UK government,t
1	Same problem here. People and politicians refusing to respect and OBEY the will/vote of the people. THAT'S WHY WE VOTE!!! A GREAT DAY FOR THE UK and AMERICA. Trump acquitted soon. Victory to the people.
0	The real cost of brexit will be seen in approximately 3 years time
1	It will be a different relationship, but I think it can have the same benefits in terms of that free access to trade
0	That's one small step for Boris Johnson, one giant leap backward for Great Britain.
1	I'm afraid they'll just say it's all going to happen on Jan 1st 2021 now. The Apocalypse has merely been postponed
1	I will say I did vote partly because of immigration and other reasons, but it was mainly for sovereignty.  EDIT - OP, the media has made leave votes how to be racist. Whilst I am sure some are, the large majority of leave votes just want control of our country back.
1	Funny isn't it, we were told by politicians and experts we were going to have emergency taxation if we voted Brexit because of uncertainty. In three and half years of Brexit uncertainty, Britain is booming and EU are in recession.
0	We're Out! We're out of our minds!
1	Strangers in Brussels calling the shots for your country was a insane system.
1	So according to this the only good thing about brexit is the apple business profiting
0	Brexit has suckered millions of people into a situation where: -a UK government has wasted £130bn - enough to DOUBLE
0	This i feel is going to bite them in the butt. No one in the Union is going to give them a helping hand i hope not. You need friendly helping neigbours. I now diffently Harry made the right move "get the hell out" $ of goods are going to sky rocket for bussiness owners. Alberta 🇨🇦  watch and learn!
0	A no deal has always been planned am sure the voters must have known that when they voted for Boris. When prices rise and there are product shortages I am sure the leave voters will be saying it wasn’t me who voted leave.
0	They've got a plan for the UK and it doesn't include Europe or democracy.
0	I feel sad for the workers who are going to suffer because of Brexit. The popular discontent was never about trade--it was about xenophobia, inflamed by the far right for their own ends. But now the economy of this country will suffer massive collateral damage.
0	“New things to come”  Coronavirus has entered the chat.
0	This has angered me. Why have they been so probrexit for the last 4 years and now they are pointing out what a load of bollocks it is? If they'd have joined us in criticism and fact checks prior, then we'd still be a significant country.
0	I have travelled quite a bit around the UK in the last few months: Scotland, Northern Ireland, South West England, Wales, London. I have stayed all over the country in middle range accomodation (quite good by the way) and eaten in many restaurants (equaly good). I would say at a rough estimate that 90 % of the staff are not UK born: I have been looked after by very nice and efficient people from Poland, Spain, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, France, Greece, Italy and probably numerous other countries. Who is going to take their place if Britain leaves the EU?
1	The referendum vote was a very good omen for him in 2016, and I would have thought it was quite a good omen for him in 2020
0	I wanted to stay
1	Leave. With the least amount of connection as possible.
0	Sad, really sad. Why all the hate towards hard working people?  Brexit really is Brexshit
0	We’ll see what a sort of “ Fantastic , Robust Economy “ UK hides in his pocket !
0	I have one question for the mentally deficient people who voted for unicorns. Name me one EU law which you don't like. Apart from wonky bananas and laws which have actually been made by English politicians and judges.
1	They told Globalism to go to hell! Good!
1	Ahead of her appearance at the #BrexitCelebration in Parliament Square tonight, Ann Widdecombe takes a break from stirring the cauldron of her 'cure the gays' experiment, in order to reveal her outfit for the evening.
1	So if they want us to use euros when buying goods we will also want them to use pounds or else we use the US dollar for exchange like the rest of the world
1	The only mistake was ever joining
1	I had hoped that after 31st January 2020, the remain voting faction of the UK, would at least stop spouting the acidic vitriol we have had to listen to for 4 years.  However, my hope was in vain; it seems their never-ending bile is very much still present - one only has to take a minute to read their comments on the threads of the DT's articles. I fear this is just going to get worse as we endeavour to strike-up trade deals, as we know the EU will do everything in their power to make life as difficult as possible for us during this transition period. We know this, and expect nothing less from them. It is why we chose to leave the unscrupulous bloc. Daniel, maybe there are those who voted to remain who have now accepted the inevitable, but if the comments on here are anything to go by, there are those who never will.
1	A glorious new phase of British history has begun. History pupils will see 1973-2020 period as a weird moment of doubt & weakness in Britain, but a proud, successful, self-governing Nation state from 2020 and beyond...
1	embarrasing seeing these people celebrate something so miniscule yet so representative of global collaboration..
0	Still hoping that this is actually a nightmare and I will wake up any minute now 😥
0	I am firmly for staying in but such interference is unacceptable.
1	The two richest countries in Europe arent(wisely) in the E.U.go figure that
0	Great to see SNP MP Owen Thompson ask #BorisJohnson to  #ReleaseTheRussiaReport in today's #PMQs. The PM's answer was of course to dither and delay. Nothing new there then!
0	Billions of pounds going out and millions of invaders coming in ,,,what a crappy deal .
0	We’ve had years of freedom of movement to do just that, but Brexit will change those opportunities.
0	"Finally the EU won't make our rules"  Interviewers should then say "OK great, do you want the Tories to make your rules? Because that's what you've done"
1	Back to independence 🇬🇧- we should never have joined the EU in the first place.
1	I'm not going to cry if companies leave the UK because they can't afford to pay British people livable wages. Not everyone wants to live 6 to a 1 bed flat.
0	Were being dragged out of he European Union without our consent
0	We Germans ( Germany and Austria) must stay in the EU and we must do our best for the EU.
0	The Brexit was/is the worst thing we have ever done. " The long walk back to sanity starts now." Indeed.
1	And now straight a Nexit!
0	No free trades for you man you crazy you pay to be EU member any idea how many jobs will be lose more and more brands leaves UK
1	happy Brexit day everybody
1	If they did that, they’d be flipping the bird at democracy.
1	Populism wins. Brexit wins. The people win #Brexit
1	It’s time.
1	Good luck GB, be great again!
0	They better worry about Ireland
1	Congratulations to the British people. You have a ton of support from across the pond. We can’t wait to get rid of our Democratic Party here. Keep the faith!
1	united Europe is not a dream, its a nightmare. if Europe stays together it will eventually become like the United states, where all states become second to a federal government, that does what the huge corporations want and the states will eventually start to deteriorate, that is what is happening in the USA.In the USA the 1% of the rich now have 40% of all the wealth, while the remaining 99% have 60%, that is an increase of about 120% for the rich, in about the last 20 or so years, and that is steadily becoming more out of balance. When the rich can easily manipulate the population, through bought politics, it isn't going to benefit anyone but them, that is why the rich are working to unite the world, so that they can easily manipulate it.
1	Brexit is a victory for the British over the multinational corporations and globalist elites who want to enslave the rest of Europe in their 4th Reich project.
0	This woman is horrendous - sums up the UK media perfectly! >:(
0	Is there anyone else who hates the fact we are leaving the EU today
0	As someone who has worked for the UK government in its economics  departments; on paper voting leave is simply ludicrous from a financial  point of view.  I shall be voting remain.
1	And to think only a couple of months ago we had a paralysed parliament that could only agree to disagree! Boris Johnson winning the General Election on December 12th will go down as one of the most important occasions in the history of the United Kingdom.
0	We are leaving the civilised world why? Because Britain has become a "scaredy cat" it seems a huge number of our people are scared of foreigners and don't seem confident in themselves to compete with them so have picked up their toys and "run'd away"What has become of our once great nation that we don't want to join in but want to hide by ourselves in the corner making snide remarks about others
1	The eu are showing the world what they are about.
0	How I feel? I watched Boris Johnson (whom I don't consider to be a prime minister of anything)..and looking at that idiot and listening to his nonsence made me realize that I have to make it out of the UK before the end of this year...being in the mercy of these kind of people is frankly frightening!
0	Remain. Only regrets was not realising how old fashioned my family is.
0	Thanks for making the U.S. look a little better in comparison. Idgits.
0	Britain is Confused! Britain hurt itself in its own confusion!
0	We have lost our freedoms and we always were independent.   You’ve stolen the opportunities and rights of the young generation that you yourself were happy to throw away.  Well done!
1	Remainers are a nasty bunch. I genuinely believe they have a mental disorder.
1	The UK was once incredibly powerful!! We don’t need anyone!!’
1	It's great that they have no more globalist agenda forced down their throats!
1	absolutely no eu fishing in british waters.
1	And about time, we should never have signed away our rights in the first place
0	For most Brexit voters the poll was nothing more than an outlet to express their bigotry and their xenophobia.
0	The madness of Brexit is when 1 country thinks that 27 countries need 1 country more than 1 needs 27.
0	what exactly is the advantage for the brits to exit? this is stupider than the 2016 election here.
0	I can't wait to watch this backfire miserably.
0	I'll be very surprised if the UK remains a whole after all this nonsense.
0	Just words of no substance from Boris the Charlatan and his party of Liars, who have duped the electorate with empty promises and platitudes of 'Stiff upper Lip' chicanery. All we ever hear from BJ is bluster and indignant rants.#notmyprimeminister
0	Hilarious and beautiful trolling by the EU.  Pay up, UK, and FO.
1	Poor soro$. All of that money spent on globalization for nothing!
0	The process of leaving has turned into a sad display of vindictive amamosity towards people of different opinion, it's obvious that the UK has become a poorer place, morally, socially and culturally.
1	Brits were an obstacle to so many reforms we tried to pass that would actually make it better for everyone.
1	Why is vice president very upset? LOL
0	really , the UK or whats left of it are the one begging for a deal remember ,
1	Why would anyone want to remain in? I cannot fathom why millions would want to concede their sovereignty to unaccountable and unelected career bureaucrats!
0	I'd tell the UK go someplace else for trade I wouldnt with the if I was the eu
1	I voted Leave because I am a socialist Old Labour man. The EU is an organisation devoted to taking power away from the accountable level, the national government, so it can be exercised on behalf of big business.
1	It’s not the people of Europe we dislike it’s the corrupt EU commission and the EU superstate project.
1	What’s with the #StopBrexit guff? #Brexit happened last night legally at 11pm because as a proper democracy we respect how people voted.
1	The Society is divided because of a lack of respect by the losers of a legitimate democratic vote
0	In fairness the media have a dilemma - all the facts so far show that Brexit is a massive mistake and will seriously damage this country and our lives (and our children's) for decades.
0	The Netherlands is envious, wishing you the best, hope my country regains its souvereignty in the future as well.
0	Brexit is a stupid idea driven by xenophobia and chauvinism and I don't know any Remainers who feel differently. This country has made a disastrous mistake and ordinary working people will pay for it through job losses and reduced living standards and savage cuts to public services. Of course, a few disaster capitalists will get very rich. Must be rubbing their hands at the prospect of slashing workers rights, health and safety and environmental standards.
0	what do we get out of it ????? less than we put in
0	Don’t start another war on European soil, again. So called friends
1	Westminster waking up outside the EU, but with no sign #Brexit will be done anytime soon.
0	I honestly can't say this enough but fuck brexit, fuck British insular attitudes, fuck the UK union and fuck the Westminster government twats. My country didn't want this. My country didn't vote for this and our people deserve fucking better #LeaveALightOnForScotland
0	My opinion of Brexit has been unchanged since it happened: The UK shot itself in the foot with this move.
0	We shall be no more independent, less global, and with a very uncertain future.
0	Do not exit..be united with europe..wake up
0	i'm just getting drunk until well in the morning then see what shit looks like tomorrow, probably still be the same but somehow tomorrow lost, the real storm will happen at the end of the year for brexit to take affect, well what a stupid country we have now
1	Now that can be the colony of it's past colony.
0	No We should remain
0	Hope you like paying for more expensive food!
1	You guys do you. I think because it passed in a vote, the will of the people should not be ignored, whether it's a wise decision or not.
1	The people voted for it. The government is doing its damndest to avoid doing what the people who employed them asked for. That’s disgraceful.   On  the subject of Brexit, itself, I would strongly favor it if I were a citizen of the UK. I can’t imagine tossing national sovereignty out the window and handing my life over to unelected foreign bureaucrats who don’t give a damn about my rights.
0	Funny how little the media has ever bothered to examine the perspectives of the other EU nations in all this. It's all about what's good or bad for us,nobody seems to give a shit what harm it may do to our friends and neighbours.
0	brexit is like going to a club thinking picking a fight with the doorman and tearing up your membership card will obtain entry and more membership advantages.
1	The thing about paying into the EU budget, we no longer have MEPs, we have left. There is a continuing relationship but significantly different. We should only be paying a small amount into the budget to cover trade continuing currently etc. Not anything like the full payment.
0	In my complete sadness, the yobbish mentality that seems to have saturated the U.K. seemed to be everywhere, whist they celebrated and let off fireworks I feel I’m mourning the loss of a very close and much loved friend. My stability is shaken and I feel isolated from the country I must call home.
0	Bye bye London finance industry!
0	If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will be a relative economic disaster for us all. The only way for those of us who remember life outside the EU to show you, is for the millions who dont know to vote to leave!
1	Our politicians and the civil service have failed to deliver any economic benefits. We won't be able to make our own trade deals, control our own tariffs, we won't be able to manipulate our tax rates or employment rights to gain a competitive edge over the EU, nothing.
0	Global Britain - soon to be a provincial backwater thanks to the tories.
1	ITS OK TO BE INDEPENDANT !!!!!!  MY UK  IS AND WILL BE GREAT AGAIN !!!!
0	And so the nightmare begins
0	Brexit is boring. It and Donald Trump are horrible and pretending there is any nuance left more than that is a waste of time. If the audience can write the same political jokes as you, you don’t belong on stage.
0	Brexit, another really bad conservative idea brought to you by the people with bad hair.
0	Terrified Brexiturds fantasise that Remainers  are as desperate as them, because it's the only thing that makes them feel better about themselves.
1	If I were a British citizen I would vote to leave. The EU is a  anti-democratic, bureaucratic monstrosity that only serves itself. It is  filled with failed politicians who are paid huge sums of money to do  nothing but fill their pockets. The only thing we need in Europe is free  trade. Brussels in its current form needs to go down.
1	I'm only 26 so I'm not like the vast majority of those my age who voted remain but like you, I've lived all over. UK obviously, USA, UAE, China, Africa. I voted leave for the EXACT reasons you listed. There are so many more opportunities for us as a country out there and I want us to be in the best position to capitalise on these.  Reading reddit abd watching the news these past 48 hours has made my blood boil. Yes I can understand people are frustrated by the result but fucking hell not everyone who voted leave is a racist, uneducated, economically illiterate bastard. There are a multitude of reasons to vote for one or the other side and now that the decision has been made we should all just move on together and make the best out of the have we've been dealt.
0	once again, the youth of the UK lose out
0	Of all the be careful what you wish for examples, "Brexit" is right there at the top of the list.  Ok, maybe second, after "President Trump".
0	The brexit bird brains seem to think that anyone that doesn't agree with them is "Establishment". Boris is anti establishment, apparently.
0	I sure hope I am still alive to see Scotland and NI, as members of the EU but free from the current UK union, vote to block the prospects of a return to the EU by little Brexitland. Even if just for a little while for jokesies/revenge  You may have shafted us with this ridiculous Brexit but we will have the last laugh
1	Classic example of the political elite being so out of touch with the average man in the street.
1	Its better than Papa EU
0	We didn’t transfer our powers to Brussels. We carried our powers to Brussels, and used them there, for the good of all Europe, for nearly half a century. Now this era of contribution has come needlessly to an end. I’m angry. And heartbroken.
1	he Britain should leave EU for the sake of Freedom and democracy.
0	It is only right, and the UK should not expect to get something for nothing. The UK played themselves, and I hope they get fucked.
0	Ministers have refused to be honest with the public about the choices they will make particularly in terms of economic impact, the increase in red tape, and growth in the size of the state
0	So, we left the EU just 4 days ago and it's all falling apart. Promises made are being broken. Lies are being told. The fishermen, farmers, car manufacturers and UK businesses are being sold down the river. We don't need a deal they say. What a bunch of charlatans! #ToryBrexit
1	The United Kingdom was great before the EU appeared, and it will continue being great after leaving the EU.
1	We're all Brexiters now. I hope the Remoaners get on board with reality and play a constructive role. Stop living in fantasy world where there will be no Brexit. The people have spoken and we need to get on board and make Brexit a success.
0	It’s “proved” nothing yet - no right or wrong. The UK will now have to prepare itself efficiently, sow new opportunity, harvest it, then sustainably and fairly distribute the bounty. We’ll see I guess.....
1	Maybe the EU can chlorinate itself and cleanse it of its own poison, before it swallows it.
1	After 47 years... FREEDOM!
0	Let's get #LiarJohnson removed, #article50 cancelled and Corbyn installed to do all those properly
1	Given the right to - given the opportunity to vote, I voted for Brexit because I've never approved really of the European Union, I never approved of it because of its attempts to confiscate national sovereignty in all the issues that matter.
0	Brexiteers. From today you no longer play the victim. Not anymore. You are now - all of you who voted for this - *accountable*. Lack of trade deals? It's on you. NHS sold to the wolves? It's on you. Endless layers of red tape that weren't there before? On you.
1	If Johnson gets this right, we could be seeing the start of putting the Great back into Great Britain. For all its people.
0	I have never felt less British. For those who voted out due to immigration, maybe they forgot who treats them when they are ill, or teaches their children, or keeps their area clean, they are ignorant to how much many immigrants contribute to our society.  I am incredibly scared about the prospect of my future. Who knows if my parents will be able to afford for me to go to university? The imminent fall of the pound suggests further economic downfall, my future was left in the hands of people who I’ve never met, whilst the 16- and 17-year-olds of the country, on the edge of our future, were not allowed to vote and now have been left isolated on our tiny island.  Just like all my friends now, I am close to tears, the prospect of such a severe unknown is so unnerving and I feel like we’ve already begun to fall apart.  I think we’re all acutely aware that had 16-year-olds been allowed to vote, it would have been a different outcome. Please pray for our futures.
1	England's loss
0	Brexiters be like: 'this is fake news'
1	What now?! We're still paying those thieves!? Trade deals take so long because they can milk that cow with endless committee meetings.
0	Who can I trust? All I know is that I voted remain and I have no regret.
0	With lowered security and almost no help from EU countries such as Germany and France, the UK will become a bigger terrorist target than it already was
1	Don't blame you for not going along with the globalist. Congratulations on your Independence being regained best wishes for you guys and girls from the United States.
1	Finally, a country with our own democracy. No more stupid EU laws
0	Brexit for UK is a disaster  economy.
1	If the remainers just hurry up and finish their tantrums, dry their eyes and get behind us putting Britain first, there’d be no reason why we can’t be a super power again
1	Nothing more beautiful than a bunch of socialists crying the end of a failed project
0	It is the 41st Millennium. For more than a hundred centuries Theresa May has sat immobile inside of the British Parliament. She is the master of Brexit by the will of the Queen, and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom by the might of her inexhaustible promises. She is a rotting carcass writhing invisibly with the power of strong and stable government. She is the Carrion Lady of Great Britain for whom a million votes of no confidence are rejected every year, so that she may never truly die.
0	He is not my Prime Minister. He is a charlatan.
0	Are they going to plan what to do next by tossing up one of those new ten Bob bits heads kiss the left cheek of trumps arse tails the right?
0	Britain, you have been naughty. You are not going to get a third chance.
0	If our goods don’t comply with EU standards they won’t buy them. It’s hardly rocket science!
1	Vote leave mainly because   Cadbury moved factory to Poland 2011 with EU grant. Ford Transit moved to Turkey 2013 with EU grant. Jaguar Land Rover has recently agreed to build a new plant in Slovakia  with EU grant, owned by Tata, the same company who have trashed our  steel works and emptied the workers pension funds. Peugeot closed its Ryton (was Rootes Group) plant and moved production  to Slovakia with EU grant. British Army's new Ajax fighting vehicles to be built in SPAIN using  SWEDISH steel at the request of the EU to support jobs in Spain with EU  grant, rather than Wales. Dyson gone to Malaysia, with an EU loan. Crown Closures, Bournemouth (Was METAL BOX), gone to Poland with EU  grant, once employed 1,200. M&S manufacturing gone to far east with EU loan. Hornby models gone. In fact all toys and models now gone from UK along  with the patents all with with EU grants. Gillette gone to eastern Europe with EU grant. Texas Instruments Greenock gone to Germany with EU grant. Indesit at Bodelwyddan Wales gone with EU grant. Sekisui Alveo said production at its Merthyr Tydfil Industrial Park foam  plant will relocate production to Roermond in the Netherlands, with EU  funding. Hoover Merthyr factory moved out of UK to Czech Republic and the Far  East by Italian company Candy with EU backing. ICI integration into Holland’s AkzoNobel with EU bank loan and within  days of the merger, several factories in the UK, were closed,  eliminating 3,500 jobs Boots sold to Italians Stefano Pessina who have based their HQ in  Switzerland to avoid tax to the tune of £80 million a year, using an EU  loan for the purchase. JDS Uniphase run by two Dutch men, bought up companies in the UK with  £20 million in EU 'regeneration' grants, created a pollution nightmare  and just closed it all down leaving 1,200 out of work and an  environmental clean-up paid for by the UK tax-payer. They also raided  the pension fund and drained it dry. UK airports are owned by a Spanish company. Scottish Power is owned by a Spanish company. Most London buses are run by Spanish and German companies. The Hinkley Point C nuclear power station to be built by French company  EDF, part owned by the French government, using cheap Chinese steel that  has catastrophically failed in other nuclear installations. Now EDF say  the costs will be double or more and it will be very late even if it  does come online. Swindon was once our producer of rail locomotives and rolling stock. Not  any more, it's Bombardier in Derby and due to their losses in the  aviation market, that could see the end of the British railways  manufacturing altogether even though Bombardier had EU grants to keep  Derby going which they diverted to their loss-making aviation side in  Canada. 39% of British invention patents have been passed to foreign companies,  many of them in the EU The Mini cars that Cameron stood in front of as an example of British  engineering, are built by BMW mostly in Holland and Austria. His  campaign bus was made in Germany even though we have Plaxton, Optare,  Bluebird, Dennis etc., in the UK. The bicycle for the Greens was made in  the far east, not by Raleigh UK but then they are probably going to  move to the Netherlands too as they have said recently.  Anyone who thinks the EU is good for British industry or any other  business simply hasn't paid attention to what has been systematically  asset-stripped from the UK. Name me one major technology company still  running in the UK, I used to contract out to many, then the work just  dried up as they were sold off to companies from France, Germany,  Holland, Belgium, etc., and now we don't even teach electronic  technology for technicians any more, due to EU regulations.  I haven't detailed our non-existent fishing industry the EU paid to  destroy, nor the farmers being paid NOT to produce food they could sell  for more than they get paid to do nothing, don't even go there. I haven't mentioned what it costs us to be asset-stripped like this, nor  have I mentioned immigration, nor the risk to our security if control  of our armed forces is passed to Brussels or Germany.  Find something that's gone the other way, I've looked and I just can't. If you think the EU is a good idea, 1/ You haven't read the party manifesto of The European Peoples' Party. 2/ You haven't had to deal with EU petty bureaucracy tearing your business down. 3/ You don't think it matters.
1	Happy independence day everybody. No longer ruled by a committee with a pretend parliament. In future if we want things to change, we can vote for change. Our lawmakers are now fully accountable to us. Hopefully a change in voting system will be the next big change.
1	the nation will come out of it stronger, with new purpose, a renewed identity and ready to compete in the fast evolving 21st century.
0	i just wonder when the uk will pay taxes for shipping goods from china.Remember you will be surrounded by eu sea boarder  maybe  it will be cheaper via Norway
1	Leave. I like the people making laws that I have to abide by to be accountable to me and the rest of the public. We haven't yet been allowed to veto any of the laws the EU puts through, and we don't get a vote on who runs the EU. It's a dictatorship with less fewer executions.
0	It means the UK's economy is screwed for the next 3-5 years. Have fun with that.
1	For me it was all about sovereignty, the ability to make our own decisions and not be ruled by the faceless, non-elected bureaucrats in Brussels; not to be frogmarched into ever greater political union and the creation of a European superstate which no one ever sought my opinion over. It was about regaining control over our own borders and regaining a say into our own destiny.  It was also about uncontrolled migration, but never about the economy. I never believed “project fear”, and if the economy does falter, now we have regained control of our country we can make decisions and take action ourselves to rectify it.  An independent Britain that trades and lives peacefully with its European neighbours, but is not ruled by them. One that listens to the needs and opinions of the ordinary people and not just those of the white, middle class, liberal elite in London.  As an older member of the population, I also resent the current ageist view being peddled by remain voters that my vote to leave was somehow selfish and of less value than those of a young person, and that I should have thought of their future. I did think of their future, it was just a different future I saw; one living in a free, independent nation, able to make its own decisions unencumbered by Brussels.  Just because I am older, my opinion is to be ignored or seen as being of less worth. You could say that as I have worked for over 40 years, paid more into society than any young person I therefore have more at stake to lose. My opinion is far more valid.
1	I bought a sandwich at the train station after the celebrations but I was told there wasnt going to be sandwiches
1	“Ducks don’t go with swans” says the woman next to me, on the subject of interracial relationships. The racism on parliament square at the moment sickens me. Completely appalled #BrexitDay #BrexitCelebration
1	Happy Freedom Day to the British People. I hope the rest of Europe follows your example and cancel the European Union...an organization that has more in common with the former USSR than with a smart and free economic and trading Bloc.
1	As an American I cannot express how pleased (and rather impressed) I am with the Brexit party and the entire affair.
0	Knowing BoJo, he will, again, say one thing and do the exact opposite, but sell it to the public as if he delivered. Like the "Irish backstop" thing.
0	Johnson clearly stated to all, he does not address difficult questions. He did not do the difficult interview. He refused to face a tv chat with one of his greatest fans, Piers Morgan. His ability to negotiate anything is zero. What he is good at is acting like a cheeky boy, with ruffled hair, spouting out nationalist jargons to appeal to masses & lying. You voted him PM. What did you expect?
0	Trade is vitally important, but also has Johnson got anything to say about social issues? Is it a UK objective to retain reciprocal healthcare arrangements for UK citizens who move to the EU after the transition period? Is it the UK’s intention to continue uprating with inflation the pensions of those citizens?
1	This just shows how useless and pointless the parliament actually is, if as you say it is a forgone conclusion done deal by behind the scenes commities.  The EU is a total sham of a democracy. It cheapens the idea of democracy.  Its why we are leaving.
1	I'm really hoping we Leave - 10 years ago I was pro-EU but I've watched it closely and now want Leave for many many reasons (below). I think the EU's greatest achievement now is the Worlds Biggest Quango.
1	The only thing they will miss is our money and access to benefits.
0	Just what Murdoch, the rest of the newspaper owners, Farage etc wanted. Now they can sit back and count their money
1	We need to slash foreign aid, the amount of money we send overseas is an absolute joke.
0	Brexit shows the power of propaganda (Leave.EU, tabloid newspapers, TV, social media) and how people could be manipulated into taking such a risky decision.
0	It's gonna be funny to watch the pound plummet, no trade deals, paperwork on imports and price rises,the u.k literally just screwed itself, who will you trade with? the e.u don't need your services
0	Why the hell does Britain want to leave the EU. It just seems like a horrible idea
0	In fact, leaked documents suggest that Theresa May’s government planned to “scale down” climate and environmental protection
1	We are a beacon of hope to people right across Europe who are trapped in the EU and hate it.
0	If there is a hard Brexit food prices will go up fore years to come.
0	Europe GET YOUR SHIIT TOGETHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	It’s striking how many lies the Brexiters are still telling. Lying about a trade deal, the trade-offs involved, the EU’s position, the transition. Even with an 80 seat majority and having achieved their Brexit. What does that say about their confidence in their own project?
0	people think they can step back in time. We'll have to see what a mess this is.
0	Feels like Britains effort at rebuilding the Berlin wall. Truly a sad day for everyone.
0	Unlucky 🇬🇧
0	Not good this brexit....I can only see there being less monies in the United kingdom....in the not to distant future...bad idea if you ask me....Chris McMahon Inc .
1	Jacob effortlessly dismantles all his opposition, it's quite beautiful.
0	The UK still thinks they are an imperial powerhouse
1	I agree, there is still plenty to do but we at last heading in the direction the majority wanted..
1	Bloody love love lovvvve you Boris 🇬🇧🥂🍾🥂🇬🇧
0	Britain is the master of bureaucracy and financial control. But now it's cherry picking in an apple orchard. How'd you like them apples Bojo?
1	I like the people making laws that I have to abide by to be accountable to me and the rest of the public. We haven't yet been allowed to veto any of the laws the EU puts through, and we don't get a vote on who runs the EU. It's a dictatorship with less fewer executions.
0	Brexiters say " Don't call us thick or stupid". Cool , can you tell us any benefits of brexit , what problems in your life will be solved by leaving the EU ?   fuck off remoaner , we won get over it , 17.4 million , you lost ,that's democracy etc Conclusion - Thick as pigshit
1	I secretly hope the leave campaign wins because it will expedite the break up of the Union.
0	#BrexitReality is beginning to hit. Opportunities lost to Brits are still open to the Irish, Poles, French, Germans, Spanish, Italians and ALL other EU citizens.
0	we need a revote now
0	Britain is a shitshow and Bozo is the star.
0	The LEAVE voters are stupid, stupid, STUPID people. Look what they did to the Pound Sterling. Never mind. Now they can live with their decision. From running huge chunks of the world to shrinking and being like Guernsey. Maybe that IS what they want. Sit at home drinking endless cups of tea.
0	So gross to see the gamfilth taking about optimism and healing. You have divided the county with your hatred, racism and xenophobia - we will always remind you of that and never settle.
1	We don't need the EU. We can trade with China. And get out of NATO too while we are at it
1	But surely all these problems will be auto-magicaly resolved by leaving the EU, since they were EUs fault anyway.
0	So much mess and confusion. Just recind article 50. We don't actually want to leave!!
1	The day is coming when Britain will rule Europe.
1	We already have a deal....and it's a great deal!
1	UK was always a great country don’t let it down now when it really needs his ppl u gotta be reasonable and except changes EU was greatfull to have UK on their side not the opposite UK is the greatest country on the world after USA so they have to start being that country
0	Yes I accept new #leave reality but it shouldn’t mean that voices critical of #Brexit must stop completely.   #democracy needs a functioning opposition.   Trying to silence all opposition to #brexitdeal @BorisJohnson is no better than calling for a 1-party dictatorship  @LibDems
0	Will the price of BMW Audi Mercedes Volvo go down as UK will be a free market?
1	after the blip in our democracy in 1975 we are back on track as a free nation and democracy. now we need to fight against political correctness and get free speech back
1	it is apparent that the eu wants to be much more than a trading bloc and that isn't what we voted to join
1	YES YES YES! Brexit Forever. and don't you dare forget it
0	Should the UK leave not so much left of a UNITED Kingdom. Scotland will have another referendum and will separate this time.
0	Brexit was based on fear.  Fear of the other. It was not a rational decision but a reactionary one.  It was bad for Britain and it is bad for the residents of the Commonwealth.  The only beneficiary of the Brexit was Russia.
1	Brexit will bring prosperity to Britain on a level of over 5000.
0	47 years of progress  4+ years of regress, wasted time, wasted energy.  Austerity was the problem, not the EU, and yet you voted these weasels back into power?
0	I think it’s the worst thing that will ever happen to this country. I think it’s absolutely disastrous,
0	The best deal is the one we have now. Remain with EU.
1	Humanity wins when tyrannical globalists lose.
0	Lots of deluded Leavers thinking we are in control The simple fact is they can do more damage to UK than we can do to EU Exporting services requires alignment
1	Farage built a party in such a short time that will inspire and change the world.
0	Another company I worked for in 2018 many colleagues were made redundant and staff moved to Amsterdam and both companies said it was due to Brexit and uncertainty.
1	I went to five of the best pubs in London and to Parliament Square. The atmosphere was amazing. Strangers shaking each others hands. Absolutely brilliant day out in London. So glad that I was at this historic moment...
1	The EU will now play with us yet again so he's got to be strong and tell these EU Muppets that he won't be pushed around like they did to Theresa May
1	I feel optimistic about Brexit. I'll take my chance living mainly an ex-pat in the EU. As I see it Brits abroad bring wealth into the Southern EU (with high unemployment) since most don't work and yet spend money and buy property - whereas the EU has exported poverty and low/unskilled workers from its East to the UK in considerably understated numbers. Brussels has everything to lose by upsetting the UK.  Masks are starting to slip everywhere.
0	Indeed take a bow brexiters, you must be so proud. You will now have PM Boris Johnson to get a better deal than a truly respected statesman Cameron, good luck with that one... You must feel liberated now you will have 'control'... 1) The multi national companies making the DECISION to move their EU base from London and invest elsewhere - JP Morgan, Airbus and believe me many, many more to follow. 2) The EU having to TELL US what the leave terms are 3) Taking back our borders even though ANY trade deal must have freedom of movement. 4) Pensions that will face a decade of uncertainty as markets toil and the economy shrinks - just look at today's NEGATIVE CREDIT rating. 5) The prospect of the Scotland DECIDING to break up Great Britain. Thank goodness my children have a decade before they need to find work and I have many years before retirement. Great Britain, whatever that may look like in 5 years, faces a dark future. Will the last person to leave please turn out the lights.
0	Watching in horror from Canada, I just feel sorry for all the decent people of Britain.  All 48% of ‘em.
0	Leave and live with the consequences. British politics have gone from the relatively sublime to the ridiculous and now into the realm of pure farce.
0	For a nation that prides itself on its football, this is the mother of all own goals. Good work you muppets.
0	And tucking the people up along the way.
1	Burned an EU flag this morning in my back garden and asked Alexa to play "Ode to Joy" as my wee contribution to the celebrations today. Can't tell you how happy I am!!
0	Why am I so fucking miserable today? We got are laws back. Are sovrenty. We’re not being governed off an EU. And yet here I am, feeling like I want to crawl under the bed and hide from every person in the world. I’m not angry, I’m just disappointed
1	It was a big mistake by Blair/Brown Labour to open the doors to all comers to rub the Tories noses in diversity. They rubbed their own supporters noses in it more than Tories.
0	Brexit is a shit storm, it clearly isn't working out for anyone and the British are going to lose more than they gain and i think that they should just revoke article 50 instead of waiting for something to happen
1	I was happy to stay but i am thankfull democracy has been adheared to and people "refusing" to accept it just look like and absolute idiot, leave the country go live in europe
1	A truly wonderful and historic moment
1	It is the remain supporters who will find the future hardest to reconcile with. To have so little pride and faith in your country is a heavy cross to bear.
1	Out. I am tired of the EU being able to create our laws and regulations, being told what we can and can not do.
0	So the UK goes from being a second rate power but part of a very important European Union, to being isolated and totally irrelevant in the modern word. But frankly, my dear, who cares!
0	Insanely petty.
1	Good to know this is happening.  Plot twist EU will trash any trade deal given to them without  access to UK Waters
1	the EU needs us
1	We never were the resistance. The People voted and only remainers wanted to resist. It’s time to stop arguing and get on with it. Peace
0	I’m 17 but turn 18 in four days. This morning I’ve woken up to feel completely betrayed by my own country.  One thing that upsets me most is that this decision has been made by people who will not have to live with the consequences for as long as us. Young people voted to remain and older people voted to leave. I feel that I have been let down by an older generation who won’t be affected by the volatility of this decisions.
1	An exciting new chapter opens in our country’s history - a refreshed opportunity to enhance our bonds and partnerships with nations across the world, advancing British values globally
1	Happy. Satisfied.
0	Kate Andrews has worked for alt right, Brexit, dark money orgs and ultra RW lobby groups - never off the BBC spouting neoliberal, anti NHS/welfare support BS - producers must have a death wish or a very small list of political commentators - she loves Trump
0	Tomorrow, we regroup and reunite to begin the fight to rejoin the EU.
0	Just look at all the bad losers. They still cant see the wood for trees and after all that's been said. They seem to be quite happy with another country pulling the strings to our government telling us what to do and cant do with the threat of their own army silently growing in the background .Ih what a bunch of fools .
0	Poorly informed is a very mild way of describing those who were caught by the Leave campaign. Ignorance is supposed to be bliss but it has got us into a terrible mess.
0	It doesn't seem like ppl know why the UK joined the EU in the 70s.. It was simply because it's economy was failing, not to long after they joined it's economy started to pick up and now ppl want to leave how does that make sense??
1	Thanks for giving the public the platform to be the voice of reason. Keeping on believing in Great Britain!
0	Oxford universities scientiest and progress myst be Europe’s futyre…academies scholia not only money. The Spirit of Europe are goid relations not whose get more money and .
1	the EU places high legal/economical restrictions on trade (goods have to be of specific quality)
1	Yes, how will we ever recover from the best thing that's happened to the country in over 30 years?
0	I hope one of those Brexit leaders like Boris take over and realize how fuckin stupid and unrealistic it is to expect to an awesome deal from the EU to leave.  Take responsible for your own goddamn actions.
1	Congratulations The British people. Wellcome to freedom once again!
0	Now you will see in horrific detail how much the EU needed Britain. The backpedaling and grovelling from the politicians in Brussels will shocking to most of you.
0	brexit is like going to a club thinking picking a fight with the doorman and tearing up your membership card will obtain entry and more membership advantages.
0	Whole this drama with Brexit showed us the following: 1. democracy mechanism is broken 2. government is very unprofessional and populistic 3. we can only hope for the best :)
0	With the possible exception of selling our soul to Trump, we could have done all these things while we were in the EU. We couldn’t be bothered then, why should we have any faith now?
0	Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson are not persons with morals and conscience! Either 51st Trump US state or will continue to seek proximity to the EU ??? Either way, the British people will lose! Don't worry, as a convinced European I don't know if Europe will survive this, but I will fight for Europe and for the EU !! No winners, only losers!
0	Brexit is the biggest hit to Britain's status on the world stage since the Suez crisis. It's an act of cultural and economic suicide that is only going to make us poorer and nastier in the short and the long term.
1	Fantastic job Boris keep going. Just seen BBC interview. Keep battling!
0	the woman is in denial... she says the UK has had advantages as a member of the EU, so how can she think those advantages will remain when it is no longer in the EU??? this is the kind of thinking she and her think tank comes out with??? i for one think that Airbus will slowly move its factory to the EU...
1	Non EU immigrants support Brexit because they believe in democracy instead of totalitarianism which EU is sponsoring.
0	Brexit could potentially lead to the breakup of the UK, an unintended consequence possibly but one that is on the horizon. Northern Ireland is very unhappy with the deal because it creates a customs border with consequences there that could end with them splitting from the UK or violence. The Scottish National party gained a lot of ground in the last election which creates the atmosphere in Scotland for independence
0	Here’s an idea, how about we stay in and fully commit to joining the eurozone, but every member has to be treated the same and put the same amount of money in, also has to offer the same standard of living in each country; at your tax payers expense of course.
0	History will not be kind to your legacy. The rest of the world already sees you - and now the UK - as a pitiable joke.
1	So let me get this straight: The UK can now make memes again?
1	No deal is the only deal
0	post Brexit I will have precisely the same control as I do now, possibly less
1	Have you considered the fact that it might not he a shitshow? What if it isn't as bad as you predict or dare I say, it turns out that living standards DO improve in the next 5 years? Will you be willing to accept you were wrong?
0	We voted for sanction to be put onto us, that is what brexit is.
1	now let the exodus begin
1	It takes a man to do the job, eat your heart out Theresa May!
1	I firmly believe that the EU as currently structured is doomed to failure.
0	It makes Britain poorer, weaker, less influential, less respected, bitterly divided.
1	If we didn’t have a transition period we would have crashed out which apart from a very small %of people no one wants. So yes we have to follow rules for 11 months, while we sort out a deal, I don’t see what the big deal is, and why those who clearly wanted remain are trying to turn this into a negative thing lol, they are getting a tissue to help dry those eyes until mommy and daddy’s divorce is final.
1	Just as in the United States, the Middle Classes anger & blame due to the concentration of wealth problem was directed away from the real problem! In the case of the Brits, it was directed torward the EU! BREXIT will show the Brits that they were lied to & how beneficial EU membership really was! Re-entry to the EU will be without the preferred benefits that they threw away! Do you enjoy being played by the dishonest Conservative Media?
0	Thick. Shame on the English
0	I think it was a poorly planned out plan that will harm England‘s foreign relations.
0	Brexit was a disaster from the beginning.  It started with lies told about the EU, Farage even apologized for the lies.
0	brexit is the worst possible thing for our country
1	I don't understand, they haven't even tried Brexit yet, how can they complain that Tories are subverting democracy when they are pledging to do the same?
0	The country are divided down the middle. But I'm getting sick of the brixiters say anyone who doesn't agree with them are disloyal traitors. I love the UK. I was born here. But why can't I express my views about brexit without being told I'm a traitor?
1	must say, I feel immensely proud. To all those ( that’s you ) for digging in. Putting up with constant vitriolic attacks from the ‘left’. We stood firm, kept going,  we achieved our aim. #brexit achieved against all attempts to thwart democracy. I applaud you all
1	Go, Brexiteers, Go! Vote the Oxbridge globalists out of office!
0	So, with Boris commanding Parliament, with nobody left to blame the situation he finds himself in, he cannot even muster a trade deal equivalent to Canada.
0	The EU must feel like they are negotiating with a mentally disturbed child who spends most its time shouting incoherent nonsense to appease the derranged voices (aka leavers) in its head. How can you have a negotiation with someone who is completely detached from reality and lacking any self-awareness regarding their current predicament?
1	I voted to leave this EU train. It was meant purely as a trading union. Nothing else. It is becoming the soviet union in Western guise and I do not want it. I do not want any laws coming from Brussels. That and the EU has pretty much gutted countries like Greece.  Nobody would invite an stranger into your home without some kind of assessment of the person you invite in. Not because you are racist which seems to be the go to argument because leftists cannot seem to engage in sensible conversation. I want people assessed prior to entry. Because I give a dam about those living within. One of the many reasons the UK is now in such a state is that we have had such an influx of migrants that we now do not have the infrastructure to deal with it. We have an incredible housing shortage, our schools are pretty much full and the the NHS is on the verge of crumbling because it simply cannot cope anymore. If you really want to move to a different country is it really that much trouble applying for a visa and being checked to ensure you are not a danger to the populous? I personally don't think so.  You should always be in driving seat of your own destiny.  The Americans fight for independence against the British was not much different. Any American wish to be governed by the UK? Would be the same for India. The EU is nothing more than empire. And every empire in history has failed, and for good reason.
0	I stay European and I stand by the EU! A reason for me to say "bye" to a nationalist England!
1	About bloody time. The people have spoken, this is what the majority voted for.. Happy Days
1	A shame for the british people who vote for leaving the eu  ... At the end, Merkel destroyed europe with her politic ... No Merkel, the british people maybe want to stay within the Union
0	Good luck GB, be great again!
1	Vote leave and take back your democracy.
0	Why? Why do you want to leave? How does this benefit anyone?
1	Only good deal is a NO DEAL, please just leave, talk or not when we are 100 % out.
0	Before entering the European Union, UK could not buy even oil
0	We are watching history unfold good job UK.
1	People don't seem to realise that US in the UK are in a better position than the EU since if they don't give us what we want they lose access to alot of the natural resources services and the 2.8 trillion market we have.
1	Brexit will spread economic growth across the nation
0	Still as stupid as ever then? How’s the Brexit family snowflake?
1	Congradulations Britain! Condolences to the BBC.
0	Same as aircraft engineers have to have EU licenses and qualifications. Those issued in UK will not be accepted in EU airports. Friends of mine in Spain are having a nightmare.
0	The rich will get richer
0	Very sad indeed. One day we will return EU
1	Brexit was never simply about trade; for many it is a matter of principle
1	is the french man upset because he cant gang up on us anymore
0	I do not wish suffering in the UK despite regarding Brexit as appalling. That is a dark road.
0	Personally, I think they would have been better off in the EU, but they voted to leave, so that's their decision.
0	Britain is hacking off one leg for the freedom to hop on the other.
0	God save our queen god bless united kingdom
1	Congrats to the Brits! If leaving the EU was such a bad idea, why did the EU fight so hard to make them stay? Obviously, the EU stood to lose more than the Brits did.
0	The higher paid, influential jobs go with them. The tax base goes with them. The investment goes with them.  We're bleeding to death and Leavers don't care as long as they get to keep "foreigners" out (increased immigration has already been agreed) and "take back control" (only to give it to the yanks).    Good job. Well done.
1	I'm so happy for you Brits, well done! I only wish we were leaving also.
0	Love the fact they played recorded bells in Parliament Square tonight. Even their victory chimes are ersatz. Plastic playboy patriots. #BrexitDay
0	UK leavers must realise that they have walked away from 400 millions customers. Nothing can replace that, absolutely nothing. All that will happen is UK will have to adhere to CE quality control on all imports or UK get no access. It will be an EU red line.
0	So, to sum up. There's a chance that it won't be as catastrophic as some sources say, but I don't know either so it might be a whole lot worse. Brilliant
1	cant wait EU to collapse and ASIA to UNITED- american .
1	I strongly believe EU will have a great future! The presence of the British with their selfishness and self-centeredness made the union weak and ineffective. Finally they are out!
0	Tonight in a couple of hours I will no longer be a European, I will lose the right to work freely anywhere in Europé
1	"we're more than a star on someone else's flag", the quote of the decade.
0	It’s all making me 80s nostalgic. Just need the forthcoming mass unemployment and we will be back where we started!
0	This is the beginning of the end. Feels so sad.
0	A collective act of self-destruction. Angry with their circumstances, a large number of people have decided that an appropriate response is to smash up their own home.
0	The EU's job is to represent their members. Now we are in competition with them. Dont expect any favours.
1	Thank you Nigel for everything you have done, 2 more weeks and we start to become independent
0	All I can say is what a fucking joke.  It's so ironic they paraded the big bastard of a bus around with "we will give 200 million to the NHS" and then it turns out they lied already fucked me up, now this shit…
1	So long Britain and good luck! Well deserved.
1	Love our country now this has happened
1	Freedom at last.
0	To train people you need to have people who want to be trained. That means years of gaining qualifications and skills and having someone who will support you during that time. Whatever training you offer it will not change people's attitude to work who think everything was easy for others and everything should be easy.
0	Our economy is doomed when we leave, less doomed but still fucked with Mays deal, and UTTERLY doomed if we leave with no deal at all.
1	I don't trust any kind of major government which is so undemocratic (the parliament can't propose laws, those can only come from an unelected council of bureaucrats) so getting the UK out of it is needed.
1	One of the greatest days in our proud history on behalf of the nation a big thank to Boris and his cabinet , special thank you to Nigel Farage he deserves a knighthood  lets make Britain great again, time to clean up our country, bring back national service and  bring back  the death penalty. GOD SAVE THE QUEEN
0	So the UK goes from being a second rate power but part of a very important European Union, to being isolated and totally irrelevant in the modern word. But frankly, my dear, who cares!
1	73 people lost their posh cushions... No wonder they were clinging to them like crazy, trying to stop Brexit ... That will make a difference to their payslips won't it???
1	Currently, they have too much of a foreign influence on their nations policy. Leaving the union will give each and every British citizen more power in governing their own nation.
1	This is a sad day for remainers but a good day for democracy
1	Lets be honest, how many people think the EU shouldnt be replaced with something new, a sensible Europe, fit for the 21st century.  The EU is a dinosaur designed from the remnants of an age of blocs and Empires.  The futures is independence, local decision making, devolution.  In the internet age, its easy for people from other countries to communicate and work together, we dont need bureaucracy to do it.
1	UK was fine before EU and they will be fine after, just hope EU won't try to make things harder for UK in the future.. You know that those unelected bureaucrats at EU are worried that UK will be successful and that other European country will follow Britain's lead.
0	Brexit is the most self-destructive thing a country could do
0	We are a laughing stock with no real leaders.
0	However, we don't get services access to the EU unless they say so.
0	cost 150Bill so far.. and I cant forgive the LIES told by the Tabloids and Brexit politicians eg When is Turkey joining
0	The UK was in the EU with many opt-outs. The EU cannot let the UK now have many opt-ins.
0	"I deal with tough mathematical questions every day, but please don't ask me to help with Brexit!"
0	I vote remain. When people have to pay huge fees for nannies, cleaners and builders they will realise how idiotic their vote to leave was. #lovecheapbritain
1	just voted leave
0	An embarrassing mistake. Great Britain will not be greater.
0	I suspect cabinet ministers have to take an LQ test to see who are the best liars before they're allowed on TV. #BorisJohnson would no doubt top the poll. He's a Mensa level liar!
1	They didn't know what they left'' don't chat shite mate
1	Leave the EU and start getting all the arabs and blacks out of the UK. The UK made a massive mistake fighting the Germans. They were right.
1	You could have drowned in the pools created by all the melted snowflakes in Britain on 24th June 2016. Long Live Freedom!
0	I was told there would be a dividend. Maybe they meant to the owners of all those outsourcing companies we will be paying small fortunes to make this gigantic cluster fuck slightly less gigantic.
1	Economy of UK is already very strong. They can stand on their own without EU support.
1	Without capitulating May, the EU holds no trump cards to threaten the UK.
1	Let's hope so. It's time the centre left got over its unthinking sentimental attachment to the undemocratic last century relic that is the EU.
0	As well as this I have lost my identity, not just as a European, but as a Brit
0	Regardless, brexit is still a damage limitation exercise, costing billions with no overall upside for the UK.
1	Barnier still doesn't get it. It's the EU that needs the trade deal. We can manage without and keep our fishing grounds
1	Very proud to finally have the Prime Minister we’ve been waiting for!!
0	Congrats Britain....you played ya self
1	The EU, a cabal of leftists-globalists unelected officials is suppressing the sovereignty of nations and caused havoc on the continent. It has outlived its purpose and must soon cease to exist.
0	The uneducated, who naturally tend to have the poorest paid jobs, voted en masse to leave. We will have crashed out of the EU and entered a deep and long recession.
1	I was always confident LEAVE would win, but after the main tv debate where Sturgeon, Rudd and Eagle were such a car crash, then I knew leave would win.
1	I just want us to leave the eu, no deal will do!!
1	It was absolutely about immigration and EU dictatorship.
0	Same people that voted for Brexit are the ones that will suffer it’s consequence.
0	We want to provoke people to think about the impact their vote has on their lives.
1	It makes sense to get out. Why would the Britain want the rest of Europe telling them what to do? I cant stand when people try to tell me what to do.
0	I understand half of the voters opted for "leave" but almost half of them didn't. If Theresa May wants to talk about the "will of the people" and "doing it for the people" then how does she explain ignoring the many people in her country who are not happy with her approach? I cannot imagine what it feels like when the government pretends you don't even exist.
0	Already, even before we have left the EU, Brexit is damaging our country, our economy, our society and our standing in the world - damage that will be worsened by the kind of ruinous no deal being pledged by some who aspire to become prime minister.
0	Brexit was and still is the stupidest thing that the UK has done. It is likely the Scottish will leave and that Ireland will re-Unify. That is the only reasons to MAYBE be ok with Brexit.
0	Don’t forget the air. I breathed it in on Saturday morning and once I’d got past the carbon dioxide / monoxide, nitrous oxide and all other pollutants, the air just seemed more free. You can’t put a price on that benefit. Well, not until the Tories privatise air of course
1	Congratulations, you guys finally decided you didn’t want to slaves after all. Now, let’s see the lion roar.
1	i am german and i prefer the brexit
0	Its sad that the majority was deluded enough to think brexit was a good thing.
1	As a Commonwealth Citizen from Singapore, I exercised my right to vote and I supported Leave.
1	The  E union was bad idea from day one
1	The EU has caused us a lot of social issues here. The city I grew up in had acquired lots of negative cultures from EU citizens. Begging, homelessness, throwing the change down on the train floor so they could pick your pockets. They took over local bars and wouldnt employ anyone British, they set up illegal hotels next to houses where people had saved all their lives to buy. We noticed it, all of it. Im sorry Europe but some of your grifter citizens are responsible for the break up. Since Brexit vote, it has improved and its noticeable.
1	That Yarsley is an idiot, we already import from non EU countries so the UK is already set up for it.
1	Hope with all my heart that OUT wins, that so many millions of us really truly want and believe in.
0	The EU also funds innovation, which keeps our scence institutions at a world-class level.
0	We remainers must now aim for Britain to do well – and the EU even better
0	I am smelling a huge recession in #UK after yesterday’s #Brexit plan.
0	The Economy of Britain will be 1£
0	Just had some EU academics watching the once revered #BBC #political programs - we turned #off #Brexitcast - #LauraKuennsberg perpetuating #BongForBrexit is best proof of #BBC #proTory #bias & #proBrexit #Brainwashing of #viewers We are still a #democracy #LauraKuennsberg !
1	If anyone thinks this is a bad thing just know that police are beating firefighters in the streets of "Ol' Pierrie" right now. Total media blackout on major news channels on where the EU is going.
1	We're leaving, even if we have to bring back the noose for traitors. Wimp.
0	As a remainer I'm not looking forward to what the future holds
0	Honestly, what does the U.K. produce? Pretty much nothing at this point.
0	And let's make the Rejoin campaign one of tolerance, decency and friendship
1	Snowflake Londoners didn't get their own way for once! Nice!!
0	Brexit is like not caring about which lavatory pan we are flushed down as long as it is the Uk that pulls the chain.
0	I stay European and I stand by the EU! A reason for me to say "bye" to a nationalist England!
0	Gonna kill my self
1	Very interesting to see that many who regret our departure from the EU are still posting furiously.  Listen chaps, you’re talking to the air now; since the election you have been politically castrated.  We have left the EU and any subsequent negotiations with the EU will be conducted without your influence.  We know you expect, and indeed secretly hope, that this all ends in tears, but frankly we do not believe you, and even if there are problems we regard our national independence to be of greater importance.  Goodbye and good riddance.
1	We like visiting Europe but we despise the EU. Anti-EU is NOT anti-Europe. Britain is a sovereign nation. THIS is a good day!
1	Brexit is Brexit.. YEAHH WERE OUT! GLORY TO UK!
0	At least I will not have to see Nigel Farage again. Sorry for you in England... you will still see him a lot in "The Sun" and "Good morning Britain" and so on.
1	I’m pretty sure most sane people understand. The UK Brexiter’s understood that their membership was important to the EU as a host to the parasitic countries expecting to be lifted up by sucking to money out of the UK.
1	The eu is a disease...
1	The EU has shown it's true colours. It's a power hungry monster with little regard for those it rules. Only a fool would yield any authority to it, which is why I don't like the idea of our fate being in the hands of our civil service.
1	Not about imagrants it's about a second government in Brussels dictating to us and making out it's democracy.
1	Britain never really believed in the EU dream. Let them leave I say! Let them be the nation that isnt part of the United States of Europe, the sick man of Europe. I care not.
0	#brexit cost us £200bn since 2016 #BrexitShambles transition will cost us another £100bn in 2020 A #Canada-style deal will cost us £44bn a year, every year #Remain in the EU only costs us £14.7bn a year #Leaving makes no sense at all... its a CON ! Brexit means #austerity
0	very hard not to believe that the PV campaign was not primarily an anti-Corbyn move when it’s the time of actual Brexit and the astroturf has been rolled away???
1	How embarrassing.
1	We’re not going to be aligning with eussr rules, that’s not on the negotiating table, it’s not even an issue of red lines – it is not even in the negotiating room, that’s Britain !
0	I'm not saying that everyone who voted for Brexit is stupid.... but every stupid person did vote for Brexit.
1	Long Live the United Kingdom! Happy Independence Day from Glasgow
0	How is splitting apart into inconsequential, bound to be vassal states better than actually trying to work things out?
1	Can't come soon enough. Make Britain Great again.
1	It may be geographically part of Europe but that’s where it ends I for one am English not European I would like to decide that for myself and not be told what I gave to be.. Thanks.
0	Ooh I don't understand these things but I don't like foreigners.  Literally just heard this from a leave voter.
0	History exams in 2050: "Whose fault was Brexit?
0	And the first domino falls.
0	Mumbo jumbo? We are screwed with this clown in charge.
1	Thank you. Now please do not cede fishing.
1	If only we got God Save The Queen to the top of the chart, then Brexit would have been a success. It's those remainers downloading the wrong song that done it.
1	Brexit is the best deal The Eu just a flop and fully sacred disaster it will not be happened The Britain’s have the best decision to pull out from that mess Britain is more stronger and powerful without Eu
1	I actually feel a touch sorry for the eu commission. They see their influence drifting away. They try to have greater influence by making even more stupid demands, but it's too late. We've gone. Bad luck guys.
1	In 15 or 20 years when this has become a massive success, the EU is floundering or has already ceased to exist I bet you won’t find a remoaner in sight. They’d be too embarrassed to admit they were one if the U.K. is booming again.
0	Brexiteers are like someone on a high diving board. They can't climb down because to do so would be to accept that they made a stupid decision, so they are trying to convince themselves to jump even though the pool is empty.
1	People of the UK, I congratulate you on your full freedom. You did it
1	UK is funding EU with a gross amount of 20 Billion Pounds. That's what is in the news.
0	This BREXIT deal was brokered and approved by England's very own United King-Dumb Boris Johnson. Looking forward to seeing Scotland break away so they can broker their own deal with the EU. FREEDOM...from The King-DUMB!!!
0	EU GDP Dominates little Britain GDP Guess who holds the POWER of the Negotiations? LOL
1	Rule britannia! Im jealous. I hope you the best of future without the soviet european union. This mess that is called eu will fall alltogether in the future.
0	What a fucking pointless shit show this whole thing has been. Why we couldn’t have stayed, I’ll never know.
0	I'm for remain, but I live in the US (yes, am a brit). I like the premise  of Europe cooperating on things, and having collective bargaining and  rights. For example, I'd like to be able to go and work in Germany  without having to get a work permit.  I think the Remain camp should have had a bigger strategy. For  example "We will find allies towards a progressive dismantlement of  Brussels and Strasbourg. Elected and appointed officials will come home  and do all business with distant colleagues by video conferencing, thus  ending the expenses gravy-train". Sure, they'd need an industrial  strength video conferencing solution, and would have to have a moderator  to prevent the all-speak-at-once problem, but I think Google and  Microsoft would compete to supply that for free.  Westminster could  benefit from the same perhaps too.
0	In my view, Brexit for a while was the stupidest decision in a free election or referendum since 30 January 1933.
0	I don't think anybody has any idea what the economic impact of Brexit will be.
1	The British are well-known for their conservative values as well as the pride of who they are.
0	I think Brexit is an ill-informed decision that will damage the country long-term.
0	I am against the British exit.If Britain exits the EU,the Federalists will have more power as Britain is the biggest and most powerful nation opposing Federalism in the EU.
0	We won’t be able to export them and over 40% of our exports go to the EU. We do rather need them to buy!
1	we don't obey EU rules anymore
0	So the UK goes from being a second rate power but part of a very important European Union, to being isolated and totally irrelevant in the modern word. But frankly, my dear, who cares!
1	Brexit is so important, it gives us our freedom back.
0	Let's sit down and watch how UK burn down :v
1	#EU so concernced about the 'integrity' of the Single Market - why is that so important? #UK should be concerned about its Single Market - including #Scotland #Wales and Northern #Ireland #Brexit
1	Leave the Germans to their unholy, sinking empire. Thank God we're leaving. We certainly won't be the last to do so.
0	Imagine all the Brexit wives ironing their husbands’ Union Jack suits ready for tonight.
0	And the famous Blue Passports ( which could have been printed anytime in the past) can now be printed by a French Company in Poland. The U.K. will more than likely have to pay tariffs on them as well. I think that in itself summarises Brexit !
1	God bless Britain and God bless Nigel Farage!!
1	we were conned into joining EU by John Major we elected to join the Common Market
0	Brexit. Short term more damaging to UK. Long term far more damaging to UK. It's a lose-lose people!
1	The UK is oppressed by the EU and has lost it sovereignty and self-determination to a bureaucracy located in Brussels.
0	Brexit may well be the end of the Union and will have negative political ramification for years to come.
1	The EU has admitted it wants more control and closer ties over it’s members. Hell its even mooting the idea of a EU army. No thanks.
0	I don't think the UK has yet come to terms with the fact it's now a small country
0	I am a European and a rejoiner. Fuck those who used lies, manipulation, lawbreaking, fearmongering and bigotry to rob us of our rights! Fuck those who tell us now is the time for unity in acceptance of their pathetic worldview after they've spread division for years! Fuck Brexit!
0	NAILED IT! Wake up BRITTS!! Wake up!
1	The Prime Minister says we need to come together post Brexit. Here is an example of this wonderful new world
1	We made our decision to Leave.
0	Brexiters seem to think that negotiations are like a pub brawl outside a Wetherspoon's.
1	I'm incredibly proud to call this man my Prime Minister. Please, retweet the hell out of this.
0	Boris Johnson’s Brexit bill has cleared its last hurdle after the government overturned 5 House of Lords amendments, including one restoring the right of unaccompanied child refugees to be reunited with their families in the UK.
1	Keep going Boris. you have at least 17.4 million standing shoulder to shoulder with you big man
1	Well done Boris, it's the first time I voted Conservative and it won't be the last. Keep the faith!
0	when your people are stock piling meds and food it's time to rethink jumping over that brexit cliff.
1	Wow, the people of England voted to leave the EU, but because the politicians think they know best they are doing everything they can to postpone and stop what their people voted for.
1	At last we’re leaving the EU. What a magnificent and historic day. The voters of Britain have defeated the Remoaner establishment and defended democracy itself. This is the most stirring political achievement of the postwar period
0	Ok, it's been 2 days and I still think brexit is rubbish. Sorry.
1	I'm 40 married with 2 young children and a home owner. I've always been  Pro Europe my whole life in fact I have been of the opinion that total  Europe is the best solution. A European super state would dominate the  world economically and politically. Unfortunately I'll be voting Leave.  I'm doing this because of immigration only. The housing market is  knackered and my children will struggle to own their own home when they  grow up. I know this is because of government policy but if they aren't  going to do anything about it then what choice do we have? If  immigration can be reduced then demand for housing and public services  may stop climbing so rapidly.  I'm also angry at Europe because when Cameron went to euro leaders  telling them that we were unhappy and may vote to leave they didn't take  him seriously and gave some very insignificant concessions. I'm sure  the economy will be wobbly after Brent but just as we wouldn't want to  stop trading with Europe they wouldn't want to stop trading with us. If  they cut off their noses to spite their faces then balls to them anyway.
1	I approve of anything giving the finger to the EU.
0	Your PM is of the same nature as Trump. The UK will be in trouble in the next years. But you believed all these liars and voted to leave, now you'll pay the price.
1	Do really think prior to joining the EU back in 73 i think it was that if we had known that our pound would have dropped from 240 pence to a 100 pence  and that out oil and gas fields were going to be sold of to EU corporations
0	I'm sad to watch the UK self destruct, and sad that there's nothing we can do to help. You're free to seek oblivion in your own way, but you're not going to drag us down with you. Call us in 20 years if you come to your senses, fix your political system, and decide you really want to be on board. Otherwise don't waste any more of our precious time.
0	She got her country back? What? I don't think UK was captured by anybody. Delusional.
0	People really don't realise how many problems this country will face by leaving the EU
0	The German word for it is "Fremdschämen"...basically feeling embarrassed for someone he isn't aware that he or she should feel ashamed for acting like an utter tool.
1	When are Brexiteers going to realise you are not going to have your cake and eat it with cherries on top. Stop wasting time and leave now today.
1	We are now our own country again and the the Queens English is the spokken tongue hear!
1	Once again the weak Labour candidates come out of the woodwork to argue for freedom of movement once we leave. Kier Starmer uses the 'old' NHS bone, as do all the remoaners. From memory, 6% of all NHS staff are from the EU. Which means Mr Starmer 94% are NOT from the EU! So stop making everyone believe the entire NHS is run by the bloody european union ffs, idiot.
1	GUYS! IT HAPPENED! THE BRITS WON!
0	What an absolute disgrace
1	Brexiteers are as brainwashed as scientologists
1	So we lose a few quid and gain our sovereign control. Seems like a small price to pay to me.
1	The more seriously I have focused my attention on the European dimension, and the more informed I have become on EU structures and goals, the more Eurosceptic I have grown.
1	I'm often too afraid to publicly voice my view and stance on the referendum.   I'm a young person of an ethnic minority (I'm Asian), born and raised  in Britain, learning 3 European (2 of them are Slavic) languages, yet  I'd still be regarded as a racist because I'm voting leave. It's silly  that people instantly assume that if someone's voting leave, they're a  racist.
0	No-deal Brexit / WTO tariffs paid by importers of UK exports:  Beef 84% Cheese 57% Wheat 53% Butter 48% Lamb 48% Pork 30% Potatoes 11.5% Fish 9.6%  Current EU membership tariffs:  Beef 0% Cheese 0% Wheat 0% Butter 0% Lamb 0% Pork 0% Potatoes 0% Fish 0%  Spot the problem.
1	They are only upset coz they are not gonna get all the money the British government sends them I can see other European country's going next when they realise how much money their country's could save
1	Congratulations to the British people! And to Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson.  YOU did it!
1	Gudday cobber, who's up for a rock hard Brexit?
1	Europe no longer interested in Britain or Ireland as we no longer have anything to offer Europe. Hopefully once Britain leave Ireland will follow
1	Get it done & get our country back
0	Those that voted for it deserve to suffer for their ignorance and posturing.
1	Globalism is dying! Thank goodness.
0	I never consented to have my EU citizenship removed against my will.
1	The people already voted on this. I guess it's totally cool to tell the voters to go fuck themselves.
1	Nobody knows which way it's going to go, and nobody knows which way it will go. All we know is that whichever way it goes, it will mean THE END OF THE WORLD! Already, Barbara Windsor has committed suicide on EastEnders in anticipation of Brexit
0	Leaving EU will not bring UK to old "good" imperial times. Nowdays you can be stron only within an union ... but only hope the nhs will not be sold but
0	Dear Sons Today you lose many rights and opportunities I have enjoyed. I am sorry we let you down. Those that championed Brexit do not have the decent values you have. Remember who removed your rights as your generation seeks to rejoin the EU My apologies to you Dad
0	Done & dusted
1	Congratulations from Belgium, you made the right choice.
1	Boris The Lionheart! Thank you very much PM. Overwhelmingly wonderful.
0	London voted remain and they ain't happy they were out voted
0	Brexit was a fantastic example of a nation shooting itself full in the face.
1	The result could bring about a top to toe rethink of the European project. Rather than a disintegration, there could be a re configuring of the EU to make it more democratic and more accountable. Something better and more sustainable must come out of this.
0	I didn't want to leave and as a young voter I'm bitter. I'm now genuinely worried about the stability of this country, principally the political fallout with London, Scotland and Northern Ireland been for remain however I don't expect a meteor shower when I wake up. Life goes on I suppose and now we need to work with the hand we been drawn. An era of political and economic uncertainly undoubtedly will now rein over my life for the foreseeable future and will probably impact my ability to enter the job market once I finish my degree. I'm not fond of the EU but I feared the instability of a leave vote more then a decision from the EU which we would've had a veto over.
1	Farewell, godspeed and good luck, UK. I really hope that everything will turn out well for you, folks, all the best wishes! 🌳🍀🌻
0	I guess no the uk can became even more inbred
1	remainers seem to believe that the whole of the Uk revolves around London. Look outside the box you muppets
1	The way I see it, the more governments that exist, the better
0	This is what Brexit was all about. 51st state, here we come.
1	Merkel looks like my old headmistress and I still have nightmares about her.
0	Brexit will address nothing. Sort out immigration? Everyone I know on FB wasn't posting about anti EU immigration, they were posting about them Muslims or Asian refugees/ migrants coming into Europe. All Brexiters have is their old man xenophobia.. The whole project of Brexit is to make a small group of billionaires more wealthy with less accountability..
1	Congratulations UK! Well done! no more EU and German Hegemony ! Long live UK!
1	I would delete Donald Trump. I would delete Hillary Clinton. I would delete the man who was responsible for Brexit.
1	They don't have to pay outrageous taxes to EU anymore, and take in hostile migrants, who want to use their women as incubators and mooch.
0	This result doesn't change any of the facts:  • Brexit is still a terrible idea • Johnson is still a liar • The EU still won't let us have our cake and eat it • The US will still drink our milkshake • Vote Leave still cheated and the Tories used similar tactics this time • The Tories will still primarily serve their rich donors
0	This is where the delusions of Brexiters meets reality. The EU should just call Johnson's bluff.
0	hilarious though how the UK didn't leave at midnight GMT
1	It is the beginning of the end for the EU
0	I don't believe this is a very smart move, but time will tell
1	Awesome!
0	Leave voters of the UK, is this what you voted for in 2016? It’s ok to change your mind. Speak out as a #RemainerNow and make it clear this is not what you want doing in your name. It may be too late to #StopBrexit but you can

0	Boris Johnson is a shameful, selfish man who is only interested in himself. Look at his eyes in this clip. He knows he is talking nonsense, but he's doing it anyway because he thinks he can become PM on the back of Brexit hysteria. What a scoundrel.
1	Can't wait to get them British of the EU's back. Finally some good news for europé
1	Can we have another vote. I don’t think 17.4 million people did actually vote for Brexit. Arghhhhhh. Hahahahaha Ya cry babies, we’ve done it. Middle finger.
1	I'll walk away from trade talks if EU tries to bind us to their rules
0	I hope Europe gets more prosperous as a result.
1	It’s a momentous day. One in which Britain finally brings to an end a ghastly experiment that’s brought us nothing but suffering.  At midnight, I urge us all to celebrate our freedom with riotous jubilation. Finally, the hell is over.
0	So many people happy with this party going on, we will see how THE hangover will go :))
0	Brexit will probably not "End" well for it came about based on LIES and ignorance much as the election of Trump in USA. Imagine that Brexit will increase the demands of Scotland, N. Ireland and maybe Wales for independence to varying degrees. Of course, there were complaints concerning the E.U. but think Winston Churchill said it was better to be in the tent than outside pixxing in, or something like that!
0	They’ll need more than luck.
1	Cod stocks are almost depleted anyway, so there will be a price rise due to supply and demand. It's been unsustainably fished by french trawlers (allowed by the EU) in our fishing areas.
0	Brexit is not changing EU at all, but will change UK economy in very painful way.
1	To be a free nation, we have to leave the UN, it is corrupt and destructive to the west.
0	My honest opinion is that Brexit is a catastrophe of the first order, which has been driven by hate, ignorance and lies.
0	The complexities begins now . Some intresting times ahead
0	Now Brexiteers are going to keep bombarding the public with propositions that are not possible to keep up the blame on the EU for not being able to accept, always framing it as the EU being unreasonable towards unicorns.
1	Why shouldn’t the Uk undercut the EU, in trade deals and services. The Uk has left the EU, to steer its own course in business. Not make itself less attractive to investors.
1	I was on the fence until the very last minute. The major points that swung it for me:  I do not believe in a federal Europe, I don't trust DC deal on a Referendum on ever closer union. Inside of this, I do not believe in wealth redistribution inside of the union except through means of trade and aid where it's needed.  I don't believe the EU acts in our interest, nor would I except it to do so  I would like our Government to have control over our borders and our money. That said, and I stress, I have no problem what so ever with immigrants as people, I do have some problem with the scale immigration - although I'll be surprised if that changes.  I do not like the smuggness of the EU leaders, see DC's attempt at a new deal and even though our MEPs where united about the Ports regulation we were ignored.  I did not like be condescended by the Remain campaign. Whilst I did find the Leave campaign to also be rather flawed, these flaws where blown out of proportion by Remain. (IE the 350mil figure IS still a valid one .. yes we spend much of that ourselves, no we couldn't just spend it on the NHS if we left, but that is what we loose direct control over)  If we weren't already in the EU, we'd never even dream of entering it now
1	Congratulations! Power to the people well done for finally breaking the chains of the EU ;)
0	You and your govt are a spent force. There is a miasma of lies & half-truths, obfuscation & deflection, & an unconvincing manner, hanging over parliament these days. You put it there.
1	Well, yes, the UK if inally OUT, but what next? the EU was a disaster waiting to unravel since it was conceived - it will be a faint memory in 5 more years.
1	What a great leader the UK now has in Boris Johnson. So excited for our friends to have the freedom that come with Brexit!
0	three years later and you kinda watch how britain's setting itself on fire
1	The “perfect skills storm” was an issue way before Brexit was on the table so don’t give me that nonsense.
1	At the time the Euro currency was close to fall apart, which would ultimately affect the entire continent's economy and cause multiple credit defaults, which could potentially affect our current quality of living not just economically, but also in terms of freedom and possible war among nations.
1	Now begins the struggle to return sovereignty to the UK. There are plenty in the establishment that will try to undermine the victory of democracy.
1	How did we get here? It is called democracy, the voice of the people!
0	I've yet to hear a valid reason from the Brexit side for us leaving the EU. All their arguments are rooted in Xenophobia, Racism and "Little eNglander"attitudes. It would absolute folly to leave..renegotiate yes...leave no.
1	I think people are yearning . . . for this great Incubus [Brexit] to be pitchforked off the back of British politics. They want us to get on with some fantastic things for this country.
0	It was a stupid thing to do. I don't think people understood what they were voting for.
0	Little Britain sees a further class divide as the poorer become poorer and the rich carry on.
1	nationalism is the only future. globalism is an anchor to hell.
1	Boris is an articulate, jovial, and lovable character who's childhood hero was Sir Winston Churchill, listening to this speech we can see and feel the impact that this great gentleman has had on this young man.
0	I'm very worried for our country. Johnson's Brexit plans are very extreme & he may even secretly want a catastrophic No Deal Brexit, which he will blame on the EU!
0	Welcome to BoZo's Brexit Britain.
0	The best Brexit deal is no Brexit
1	Corrupt and failing EU man. I'm a staunch Brexiteer and had enough of following the laws
1	Thank you for all your efforts to get the 2016 result honoured. We have all made a difference together.
0	The future of UK lies in eating chlorinated chicken and paying 1000 pounds for a vial of Insulin. Good luck with that.....
0	My boomer grandparents voted for all the foreigners to leave, so me and my family are leaving. Goodbye, Britain, you won't be missed.
0	Time now for the left and anti-racist movements to start rebuilding the unity that was undermined by genuine and deeply felt differences over approaches to Brexit. We can start by being present and by spreading the word about this important demo.
1	What a fantastic, uplifting speech from @BorisJohnson ! Finally we have a government pushing for the UK, instead of the deafening whines of those who’d rather see us fail. #Brexit
0	Finally.... really happy for UK and EU.
0	British people will be sorry the left  it will be difficult for traveling
0	The direction for Britain is cultural obscurity ,mixed with political unrest when Scotland separates and brings an end to the idea of a United Kingdom and a end for the Union Jack,such a loss,such a pity.
1	Heres to britain producing her own things again.
0	You can quit EU but if you don’t solved your own problem it’s only fiction
0	Worst mistake we've made in a very long time and all based on lies, xenophobia and misinformation spread by the Tories, Farage and their rich buddies in the media.
1	About time, how long has it been , 4 years after the British people voted to leave the corrupt EU, but their is a transition period that will last a year where the British will still have to obey the crap laws from the EU. If we only never joined the corrupt EU  in 1973,
0	UK citizens lose the right to frictionless travel, to work, live or retire in the EU
0	It’s a few steps back
0	Well hey, on the bright side at least this shows that the US isn't the only country inhabited by far too many people with so much space between the ears they probably suffer weather patterns.
1	I've been wondering why UK is a member of EU for a long time.
1	This is an absolute failure of democracy for the government failing to enforce the will of the people.
1	Reversing the public vote because they don’t like that. How would you like it if a party in Ireland was elected and banned gay marriage. It would be quite undemocratic wouldn’t it?
1	They're still trying to dictate to us , even though we're now out.
1	Delighted to cosponsor SNP MP Peter Grant’s Bill to protect the NHS from a post-Brexit trade deal with the US &amp
0	It's not the 'UK' it's our voting system that's retarded.. once all these bitter old fuckers who think they're ode something die we'll come back.. Just probably with a worse off deal
0	The UK has lost its voice in Europe
1	I think it’s going to be a success and glad we are leaving
0	It seems the fools in the North and the Midlands who voted for this charlatan are gonna get their comeuppance!
0	The Leave side talked absolutely rubbish last night they don't have a plan so what's the point of voting Leave we will be making a huge mistake so Vote to Remain in the EU.
0	French fishermen face DISASTROUS 'shortfall' if blocked from British waters. I
0	Who is this supposed to fool? Brexiters won’t care until after they feel consequences of hard Brexit and the rest are not going to fall for this nonsense.
1	Brexit, its like the charge of the light brigade, Johnson is just a big dreamer.
0	It will leave us poorer, due to loss of the extremely good trading terms with the EU that we have now
1	The British Empire is back.God Save the Queen
1	So happy brexit finally happend, now kick those scum bag Islamic terrorists out of the country!!!!!!
0	Brexit is making UK poorer. We should stay with the EU
0	Don't worry. Mr. Johnson. The EU will do the work for you. Just sign at the dotted line. All will be fine. For you at least.
1	Let's be honest. The UK is not worried if we get a deal with the EU, but, the EU are. UK will be getting trade deals world-wide.
0	Yep. ‘Brexit good, foreign bad, do not question, only believe Daily Express.....
1	5th largest economy because we are in a trading block with the 4th and the 6th largest economies....and we speak English.....
0	Want a no deal to happen so Britain learns they are not the centre of the universe.
0	If the EU have signed it without crying about it then I'm afraid that cannot be good for the UK. No chance. Something fishy is going on.The third turd now signed.
0	Of course Brexit means that something is wrong in Europe.
0	it’s gonna be so hard to make brexit jokes now that it actually happened
0	That is sad. The Scottish and North Irish deserve to be free. It is sad that they were deceived into remaining. Hopefully, they will wake up soon and get out while the door is still open.
1	Independence day has finally arrived in spite of the anti Democrats.  Democracy won out.  Good.
1	As a UK ex-pat living & working in the horticultural export industry in East Africa I say all hail Brexit! Long live the Empiricists and the philosophies of Locke, Hume & Darwin. Going to raise a glass to Britain tonight
1	Real progress will come and England's water supplies will be free. Thank you Boris Johnson.
0	However it pans out with the Corona Virus (global pandemic or infection peters out)
1	I supported Brexit and I support Scotish independence.  Basically, I love the idea of secession. It should be done more often.  I hope I live to see Hong Kong secede from China. I hope we see a US state (or three) successfully secede as well.  These massive centralized world governments need to be broken up sooner, before we're all living under some tyrannical global dystopia.
1	Congratulations from Belgium, you made the right choice.
1	A long hard road leads to exit. Congratulations from the USA.
0	crying is good for the soul, at least we remainers still have one
0	Brexcists seem to think that voting for this shit-show will somehow magically insulate them from its effects. Still, I'm sure they'll find a convenient scapegoat to blame for the mess they caused.
0	You can keep saying it buddy. But the answer is no.
0	The worry is that now that the EU doesn’t protect us any more, America will walk all over us. We will become the 52nd state (‘israel’ is the 51st) and that will be disastrous.
1	I  am glad, Europe is a great idea on paper but not working.
1	I've waited 47 years for this event, BRING IT ON! :-)
0	The same arguments used by the UK to leave the EU can now be used by Scotland, NI and even Wales to withdraw from the UK. Scotland can forge their own economic way by joining the EU, Ireland can solve a lot of their cultural issues via uniting and Wales can set up a new immigration policy limiting the English immigrants into its country.
0	Totally agree that we ought to be doing more to train UK people to do these jobs. That doesn’t mean Brexit is a good idea though - especially a ‘hard’ or ‘no deal’ Brexit.
1	CONGRATULATION UK. CONGRATULATIONS NIGEL.......I confess, I didn't think you had it in you.
0	Well, a lot of people have now become a lot better informed and they realise Brexit is going to be extremely painful, both economically and socially, and they want it stopped!
1	The UK is the 6th largest economy in the world and we import more than we export. People would be very keen to continue to do business with us not least the Germans who will be keen we keep buying all their high quality cars. There will be trade deals.
0	Usual empty rhetoric. We all know the Tories have nothing to offer this country, just vampires sucking the life out of it. Go back to your (not very) special place in hell traitors.
0	I guess a lot of Remainers will need help packing as they prepare to move to an EU country!
1	The thing I find really sad about this whole leave v remain is, now that it's happened there are remainers who actually want the country to fail and fall into misery, just so then can turn around and say "told you so". They would somehow see that as a victory, that is beyond sad.
1	The biggest threat to western civilization is not China, Russia or Islam. The biggest threat is most of the Democratic Party and the entire European Union.
0	Good job fucking over Ireland, again.
1	The EU will soon be called the AU. Arab Union.
1	Well done Britain! It's a great day for democracy!Hope we leave next, Greetings from Ireland
1	I’m hoping we rejoin before my passport runs out!
1	Fact, it took the working class to do what was right, and you just do not like it. Suck it up losers, time will tell!
0	I think the first thing we'll see after Brexit is the exodus of young and bright talent from London to major European cities like Paris, Amsterdam or Berlin.
0	BIG EXPECTATIONS FROM THE UK
1	So proud, never thought we would get there. Well done Brexiteers.
0	What a great moment … for Farage. He can now receive even more millions from his wealthy paymasters.
1	And the good news keeps on coming for the UK post #Brexit As Facebook plan a huge new HQ at King’s Cross and Apple build
1	How come all i'm hearing about in the news is #Brexit? I thought @BorisJohnson promised to GET BREXIT DONE on 31st January. Why are they still going on about it now? The British people voted to get it done... Why isn't it done yet?!! #LeaveMeansLeave  #Brexshit
0	If British exit it will be sink or swim time, they'd be far better staying put and have Germany guide them. Don't cut the hand that feeds you.
1	How much Salt, can the remainers and the EU produce?
0	The British have a dirty secret and this secret shows the British don't respect human rights.Still secret the British Dr Mengele of human exploitation is still hiding
0	Intelligent people change their minds based on new facts and all the polls indicate that is what has happened.
0	How long until  @BorisJohnson 's handlers realise that the fight isn't over just because they want it to be? #StopBrexit #RejoinEU
0	Get Brexit done, was the slogan for the suckers who voted Tory. We are now on a very long journey which will entail much more than catchy slogans, so trust your man to bring the prize home, there's always a first time for everything.
1	Crying for their salary
1	Brexit was a total success at 11pm on Friday, 31st January. We got our country back.
0	Someone cut me up today and they had a Vote Leave sticker on their car. Coincidence? I think not
0	Thanks to whomever just woke the kids up letting off fireworks.Selfishly pissing off the many for the benefit of a few- seems a fitting Brexit celebration
0	Can't wait for all the old people who voted for this to watch their pensions and social programs get slowly eviscerated, and blame the youth for their political ineptitude.
0	Britain goes into the Middle Ages. Scotland into the future of Europe. Scots, you are a free nation, remember about the struggle of ancestors for independence
0	now is not the time to campaign to rejoin, but we must keep the dream alive, especially for young people, who are overwhelmingly #proEuropean,"
0	So it was all worth it...
0	All I'd like to know is; we are the poorest county in the UK receiving a fair few million from the EU. How much would the Brexit campaign pledge to spend down here if we were to leave?
1	Stick to your guns, Boris! The majority of us are behind you
1	Astonishing poll is packed with good news for independence supporters The most important caveat about all of the results
0	Feels so exciting to finally be able to tear up all of our existing trade deals....and then have the freedom to renegotiate them all alone without the backing and market of the most powerful business union on Earth  👍🏻 🇬🇧
0	I feel unrepresented.
1	Stay focussed brexiteers now is the dangerous time make sure it’s a real brexit not Brino
0	This is the problem of swinging the pendulum to the other extreme as a knee jerk reaction. Yes, Britain and Europe in general faced a huge immigration crisis in 2014-15. However the answer is not the other extreme where you take in 0 immigrants. Like anything else in real life, you need to find the right balance and moderate.
0	Somebody tell mrs sturgeon the scottish wanted to vote in the referendum to. If they couldnt accept maybe leaving the EU as an outcome.then why participate in the 2016 referendum. What a broken record this women is
1	We need a foreign central government to rule over us or else we will regress derp derp
1	when you are sharing a house with 27 other people it is not all about the rent fed up with the money money money argument its about democracy, we will be fine outside  VOTE LEAVE
0	If just one of these deportees are not a criminal and are merely being got rid of because of dog whistle politics by this hard right, populist government, they will have more to answer to than opposition front benches. Is this another reason why Johnson wants the EHRC dropped from the statute books?
0	It is clear that the world markets from Asia to the USA all genuinely think that not only will the UK be better off in a REMAIN, so will the global economy. They have no axe to grind in UK politics. They are looking at it dispassionately. Much as Europe irritates me sometimes, I am not voting to trash the UK and the global economy on the flimsy xenophobic ill-informed non-sense coming out of the leave camp. They cant even get the basic facts right and feel the need to exaggerate wildly about Turkey and UK contributions. If they want to leave, they can. They can go to Southampton and take a Ferry wherever they want, and they can take Nigel Barage with them.
1	England does NOT need Belgium telling it where or where not they can fish, in their own territories!  Well done mates!!!
0	The absolute low point for me in more than 30 years of professional life was the Brexit vote.
1	WE ARE OFF
1	From 2021, UK citizens and interests will be represented by... UK citizens.
0	I wonder how long it will take for the first Brexiter to openly admit some of 'project fear' warnings were actually spot on?
0	Is this brexit process messing about just currencies manipulation simply by new words which change the course of the GBP SIGNIFICANTLY moments after ?
0	In 15 years most of the brexiteers would be dead! It won't matter to them anyway.
0	I'm hoping and praying that Brexit gets called off.
0	Two events in one day. Brexit complete. US losing the last bit of integity it once had.
0	We have at least a decade of brexit, politicians trying to tell us that chlorine chicken is fine because our trade deal with the US for our banks is great.
1	I would have voted to leave because of the sovereignty issue.
1	Self determination is a major reason.  The EU went WAY too far when they started to tell EU member countries how many immigrants/refugees they had to take in to become citizens of their countries.  Trade is one thing, who is going to be a citizen of YOUR country is quite another.  The "masters" in Brussels lost the plot and got too comfortable with their power.  The UK didn't like the rules they were required to play under so they took their ball and went home because that was the best course of action for them.
0	Still not heard one tangable benefit of us leaving. And I see that ' experts' are back in fashion again. It's all one big fat Tory con
1	Thank you Ambrose, for the clarity of your thoughts.  You are right, as usual.  We have stumbled out of the EU with a declining future, into the prospect of once again aligning with the US and the Commonwealth.  We must never again  look back like Lot's wife lest we find ourselves once again in peril.  The future for us is with the Anglosphere. We must disentangle from the tentacles of the EU. Now is the time to do it.
0	Some people think it’s the most significant thing for Britain since 1945
0	Can’t wait to hear the leavers complaining that the remainers didn’t make them aware of the associated consequences in leaving the EU. All I will say is this ’you’ve got your cake, now stuff your faces and help yourself to some chlorinated chicken’. The fight has just begun and it will destroy the tories and hopefully the right wing media along with it.
0	There goes car manufacturing, fish and farm exports. I am sure those little Brexit towns that relied on these industries will be very happy with it. Their Happy Brexit day celebration in 2021 will surely be out of this world.
1	Shows why you have to fight, kick and punch the teeth out of libtards.  If you do that, you can prevail!
0	I’m convinced that this shameful blip in our long history will only be temporary
1	Good for UK that they got their country back
1	Huh.. the United Kingdom is still there... I was told it would evaporate on leaving the EU…
0	Great I can book a EU trip in April now
0	Fascism is now openly expressed in England... Soooo good for the EU to have gotten rid of you !
0	The EU has to be strong and make the UK an example of it - with all this love going and whatever, let us remember the lies used by the Leave campaign.
0	we WILL follow European standards.
1	The EU is a complete sham. It’s a criminal organisation that should be dismantled.
1	Its best for Britain to be in control of Britain just like its best for the US to be in control of the US. Death to globalism.
0	Theory shouldn’t really as that will backfire tremendously bad for the British economy. Most likely it will also bring with it a new referendum to Scottish independence as most Scotish seem to be pro EU.
0	Brexit is like England going into a football tournament arrogantly thinking they are going to win it. The English get far too optimistic in the build up and then they get taken down with a bang and start girning.
0	What's happening....#Brexit!! Shame, let's hope UK population doesn't live to regret it. The rich will be much richer at 11pm tonight.
1	The BBC editors must be choking back tears, as their campaign to ignore democracy has failed...
1	EU is a BIG Boys club, Big Company's and not at all for the People. 🤣🤣🤣😎😎. Keep it up EU, make European poor more and more. 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
1	FINALLY WOOOOO HOOOOO!!!!!!
1	We were just talking about this at work lool its a bargain
0	I wish they would fire all that white smoke at all the people who voted leave
0	"The English problem, the cause of the Brexit, is an aristocratic society that increasingly believes it's a meritocracy."
1	And that's part of the reason were leaving. The arrogant europeans have very little appreciation or respect for how the UK helped shape the eu. Out and onwards and upwards. The eu has turned into a bureaucratic technocratic nightmare tying everything up in red tape to keep all of its jobsworths employed and destroying the productive economy in the process. And the euro is a straight jacket of disastrous proportions. Glad we're getting out.
0	brexit voters = trump supporters = far right = uneducated.
1	Irony of basically throwing support behind a Brexit style party
1	the british not wise at all.
0	Grievance politics swung the EU referendum to a leave vote. Now we are about to find out what a mistake that was.
1	If the EU can't come to a trade agreement before the end of 2020.. no problem. The UK can move ahead with trade deals world wide, and the EU can come back to the UK when they are ready.
1	Project Fear = Project Fact  Well done England, truly well done
0	I'm trying to be positive, maybe we need the bad to appreciate the good, maybe this country needs to experience life outside of the EU to vanquish these ridiculous illusions of grandeur. We will rejoin the EU stronger and more committed.
1	God save the Queen and also our beloved Jair Bolsonaro, a great man. Don't believe the news from big jornals.
0	The inevitable end of Great Britain, although of course some are still in denial.
0	It's pointless trying to twist Brexit to make it fit, it ain't going to work.
1	The EU must die in order that Europe may live.   The richness, diversity, traditions and variety which is Europe must never succumb to an EU and its trajectory toward Ein Europa, Ein Volk und Ein Fuhrer.
0	The nasty, hateful small-mindedness of little Englanders. This is not us. This is what we have to overcome.
0	People are leaving Britain.. companies are leaving.. what is good for Brexit? I'm going to be french or Irish
1	Leave for me, I don't want my country to become just another state in the encroaching and unhealthy USofE.

1	Finally the day is here. #BrexitDay 🇬🇧
1	Good job UK may my Poland did the same Euro kolkhoz is a circus
1	Frankly we need to disband any type of government body that attempts to set laws for multiple countries, like the EU and the UN, we need to let countriemen decide what goes on in their own country
0	I think this is the biggest blunder in UK’s history for a very, very long time.
1	The european project is reducing the middle classes to subsistence wages.
1	They keep telling us what we can't have because we won't be in the club, then they tell us we've got to follow their rules even when out of the club. They want it all, tell them where to go Boris
1	We do not need to stay close to the EU. Why would we want to do that after all these years of wanting to LEAVE. As a Back Bencher you have very little to say that any one would want to hear. You replacement has now been selected. It is time to nip home and start packing.
1	The EU was made to help the banks make a profit by lending to them on account of the Euro. The British were very smart keeping the pound.
0	Goodness knows why England gone down this path,,,how much hatred abounds in these dark satanic hills,,,personally I think it’s the Tories not actually understanding its citizens just its finance and London...yes the European workforce brought some growth to help England use its fertile land all one way though so citizens of Lincolnshire had no health finance,then complained,,,
1	Still very optimistic about Brexit.
1	The British will face karma for the history. :)
1	Only two more days and we regain our independence.
0	I'll be voting to remain. I haven't bothered paying any attention to the  nonsense spouted by both campaigns. I've just made a value judgment of  the situation and came to my own conclusion.   Financially, it's a risk. Sure we could end up benefitting by leaving  long term but the chances of us quickly securing a good trade deal  aren't fantastic. Leaving the EU is a political statement and people are  a little deluded for thinking we have a wealth of bargaining power. We  don't. I can imagine a trade deal distinguishing between goods and  services to our disadvantage.   I'm not phased by the 'reclaim our parliamentary sovereignty'  argument. It's not like we were unaware of the supremacy of EU law when  agreeing (Lord Bridge's words come to mind: "there is nothing in any way  novel in according supremacy to rules of Community law in those areas  to which they apply"). Also, EU law is a bloody good tool for  individuals. Common law fundamental rights are dubious. Convention  rights give rise to interpretation or a DoI, that's about it. The EU  Charter of Fundamental Rights allows us to dis-apply existing domestic  law (insofar as there is conflict). That is very useful for vindicating  individuals' rights, and provides a useful check against the state given  the lack of real accountability (political sovereignty of the  electorate is a sham).  I would have voted not to join the EU in the first place. We should  be adhering to the principle of subsidiarity wherever possible.  Devolution (even if at the expense of the Union) should have been  preferred. But hey, now we're in the position we're in and we've got to  deal with it. Academia would suffer post-Brexit and I imagine that's an  important subconscious factor for me.
0	Its actually sick, I see the poorest and most destitute people in the UK gloating on facebook about the tory victory while their public services crumble around them. Complete insanity.
1	When will the penny finally drop with these EU autocrats - they are in no position to make demands on the UK.
0	I feel like the Brexiters know it's stupid, but they stand to gain  significant personal financial rewards if it goes ahead, the more  chaotic the better it is for them. They simply don't care about everyone  else That's the only way they could justify the lies and false claims.  I'm sure there's also a factor where when you preach stupidity for long  enough you do start to believe it too.
0	As always Ann Widdecombe is in denial re young peoples rights.
0	When Boris and Gove say that 'we have taken back control', who do you think 'we' is?  It's not us, the people. Not in a country governed by Tories elected by a minority of the electorate. Not in a country where the House of Lords, unelected, can over-ride the Commons. Where bishops - men in frocks with big hats - can vote down Commons decisions.  At least the EU parliament is democratically elected.  This is an awful day for the UK, and especially for England. The only glimmer of hope is for a reunified Ireland and independent Scotland going forward into the future in the EU leaving England and Wales lonely and on the outside with very few friends.
0	We should wait for those deals and see if UK businesses really benefit being outside of the EU single market
0	I think it will blow up in people’s faces, and I think that’s what it’s going to take to show people that the UK isn’t the “powerhouse” it was in the past, people need to be humbled..Brexit blowing up might just help with that.
1	The EU legislation resulted in 95% of British beaches being safe to swim in. Nearly a year ago, in anticipation of Brexit.
1	My mum 90 next month has always been upset about the way Britain dropped the commonwealth. She's glad to see the back of the EU it was sold to her ,& all those who went through a war, as a peace/trading block when it was in fact always a plan to turn it into one country one law
1	Voting to leave the EU to protect British workers and our NHS, Stop TTIP, Regain our sovereignty and self determination.
0	I lived there for 20 years when the vote came around it was spun around in immigration. Many voted leave because they honestly thought that they're would not be any more immigration into the country. This is the reason Boris did not want a revote recently. It's a sad day
1	This is just the start of the end of the EU. When other nations find out how well we have done in the future without the EU, they will leave too.
0	I have just done a Brexit  (No, not a poo, potty mouths!)  I could not find my engagement ring, panic ensued. Looked everywhere for it, thinking my beautiful ring must be somewhere else.  But it was on my finger all the time, close to home, I just needed to look properly  #Brexit
0	Now get ready for the consequences. France former president DeGaule was right to oppose UK adherence to European Union.
0	So weird , it’s like everything is topsy turvy with people actually celebrating leaving a union that brings countries closer together
1	the costs of being in eu are not worth it
1	The EU are utterly undemocratic and run by a dictatorial "bunker" mentatilty that refuses to countenance reform or a change of mindless ambition.
1	F the EU
1	It's time to restore true democracy & that is why I am voting to leave the EU on June 23rd.
1	"I think it's a great move...to be in control of your own country is a good move." YES, Ringo! Anytime there is less government, it's a good thing! #Brexit
1	Jolly Good" Congratulations Great Britain. Now vote that London mayor out
0	How anyone ever believed that the UK could afford to radically reduce its clout with Europe, or worse yet believed that leaving the EU would mean MORE clout. The whole thing is based on lies. Someone posted about Remainer distortions of Norway's relationship with the EU. Okay... sure... but none of this would have ever happened were it not for the central lie the vote was based on... that the UK would materially benefit from leaving. It was never true, and nothing will make it true.
1	Welcome to the independence club  EU is a globalist organization that seeks to destroy every ounce of national sovereignty and freedom it sees. It's downfall should be swift
0	I have felt European since I first set foot on the mainland 75 years ago, so am deeply disappointed as are many of us
0	It wont be when President Trump puts tarrifs on the Eu this will prove how powerful they think they are.
0	Well that was a nice simple process
0	Any form of indoctrination is unhealthy. Kids should be taught to have an open mind, not a closed mind. The world would be a much better place if this were the case!
0	Long live the EU and fuck Brexitm
0	The war has not been won. A battle has been won. And democracy is the loser.Already looking forward to rubbing brexiteers noses in it when we finally win the war.
0	Brexit is a disaster, Italy won't be real about its debt, and the European Union is in trouble.
0	Nobody cares about all this. The EU was going to abolish the tampon tax anyway. What matters is the availability and cost of goods on the shop shelves. My guess is the costs will in general rise after Brexit.
0	Brexit has been lies from start to finish. But you know what? Let's have Brexit. On 1 condition: OWN IT. Stop blaming EVERYONE else, stop blaming the EU. This was going to be the best & easiest thing ever. OWN IT.

0	If you have a trade mark, or a copy right, or even a patent, you don't have to take one out for each country. You can get one EU wide one for all 28 members.
1	Finally, a country with our own democracy. No more stupid EU laws like: Stiliton cheese cannot be produced in Stilton or Bananas need to be a certain curvature or dead fish thrown back in the sea because of quotas.
1	Congratulations from Belgium, you made the right choice.
1	The major problem not mentioned above is the EU bureaucracy, arrogance, jobs for the boys, gravy train, mayhem with the Euro, youth unemployment in Italy, Greece, Spain, Portugal and Eastern European countries, and the enormous amount of £billions to support this folly. The undercurrent is forever turbulent between all EU countries, and much by way of unrest in the making.
1	They have had 3.5 years. Do you seriously think Europe wants to lose that massive car industry trade. Try to be serious for once MSM instead of whipping up hysteria.
0	Reality bites, babe! I can remember the author of this piece saying, "if we vote leave, they'll give us a better deal...." How times have changed. Just remember who brought you this shitshow so they can be held to account, and remember the security and prosperity you gave up for your magic Brexit beans.
0	Well done Britain, leading the way for other European nations to follow
1	with people like Verhofstadt, running the EU then we are better out. "long live democracy"
0	the UK shot themselves in the foot for voting, not for a renegotiation of deals between the UK and Europe, but for an exit.
0	Watching the #BrexitCelebration last night I was overwhelmingly saddened by how ugly the UK has become and I am deeply worried by how much worse it will now become
1	Cheers from the States! 🇬🇧
0	Britain can't regain what it wants, the kind of power and autonomy the nation had before WWII. No nation can have that anymore.
0	Breixters: The people voted! If we don’t follow through on that vote, democracy is a farce!  Remain: We could just vote again now that everyone has more information and many are changing their minds. Wouldn’t that also be democracy?  Brexiters: The people have spoken! No take backs!
1	That's good we just want to leave
1	Why has it taken so long ?
0	A sad day.  For everyone on the UK  We all lost - even the so-called “winners”.
1	What a strange sense of cowardice that comes across from most of the commenters on here.  Instead of embracing their new sense of self determination they whine like little children being forced to leave their house for the first time, full of fear and self doubt. The EU is a corrupt monster. I don’t know how any country puts up with it.  Time to grow a pair and head off into the world. Independence comes with risk, but also great freedom.
1	Happy Brexit day Democracy prevailed Remainners you LOST!!
0	We can only keep fighting and hope that this ludicrous situation will be resolved quickly. Get us into the EEA quickly and lets avoid a huge mess up to our economy.
1	Make sure it’s a new proper version not Mays rehash otherwise you and your lot will be out as we will definitely turn to @brexitparty_uk
1	Michael Leaver The United Kingdom will be fine. It’s all to clear that the EU desperately needs the UK and not the other way around. Poland next, Hungary to follow, and Italy isn’t far behind.
0	Brexit is a mistake, aggravated by ignorance, compounded by idiocy, wrapped-up in "The Flag" by a bunch of arseholes on crack. Bugger "omnishambles", this is a clusterfuckup.
0	Get real UK,...no more freeloading for you lot, you're out, now get lost.
1	At least we can save a lot of stupid membership fee
0	Remain. My only regret is not taking seriously the chance of leave winning. I just assumed there was no way leave would win so I didn't bother engaging with any debates or discussions in the subject.
1	GTFO, they’re always slowing every reform down with their common law gibberish!
1	Free of the shackles of the corrupt anti democratic EU at last. Hopefully more member states will follow the UKs lead and bury the bloc for good.
0	Damage? Membership of the EU has demonstrably been very beneficial to the UK economy.
0	I disagree. There is no 'best of Brexit'.
0	I think in the long run the UK will regret this decision, hopefully not tho.
0	So, who wants to take bets on how long before Britain tries for re-admission back into the EU?
1	One more thing we share with our British friends - a good sense of humour.
0	Fuck Boris Johnson. Fuck Trump. Fuck Brexit. Fuck Katie Hopkins. Fuck Farage. Fuck Rees-Mogg. Fuck all this toxic, nationalistic, elitist anti-elite, paradoxical populist dumbass simplistic reactionary militaristic dangerous xenophobic bollocks. Send them away on a big lying bus.
1	Congratulations
1	Well done Boris.
1	Most of the replies here seem to be "Remain!". I usually wouldn't bother  with replying to a thread like this but I feel like the leave side needs  at least something said for them. Wall of text on the way, TLDR down  below.  I want to leave, and on Thursday I will vote to leave. I am 20,  middle class, live in central England. I am not a racist. I don't care  about in-EU migration.  My stance is that simply put I like Europe, I like the idea of a  European state and given the chance I would vote for a federalised EU  with its own defense force, welfare, head of state, common language  (Even if it was French, or even German), taxation and all the trappings  of a nation-state (provided there was adequate "state" governments for  the various nations, not unlike the US system).  But the EU as it stands now exists in a sort of political superstate  (both a country and not, with and without a citizenry) where it passes  laws without  scrutiny or accountability. The correlation between the  European election cycle and European law and policy is obscure in places  and nonexistent in others. It both is and isn't a country with national  interests.  The interests of Brussels do not correlate with the interests of the European people. It has its own set of interests and they consist of   Preserve the EUExpand the influence of the European GovernmentCoalesce the EU into a nation of some kind  On their own these interests are innocuous at first glance. Of course  it is in their interests to survive and thrive and I already said that I  don't mind a Federated European Union on paper. But in practice these  interests put them at odds with the national governments of member  states. Without a real democratic mandate, the EU is only indirectly  interested in the welfare of EU citizens.  The interests above mean that the EU is incentivised to expand its  sphere of influence into new countries instead of working with the  countries it already includes. Instead of working with countries like  (example) the UK it is in the EUs interest to bring more, potentially  unsuitable countries into the European parliament so that it can edge  out uncooperative nations on the debate floor. It is in the EU's  interest to keep expanding rather as a means to achieve its goals,  rather than simply to help its existing citizens.  What's more, the actual laws that get passed in Brussels are often drafted by lobbyists.  That doesn't happen in WASHINGTON. The degree of sanctioned, polite  corruption and cronyism in Brussels beggars belief. The second largest  lobbying industry in the world is in Brussels, only narrowly beaten by  DC, and even in DC a lobbyist can't actually draft a bill. British  politics suffer from a pretty extreme "London Bubble" and it's true that  civil servants and politics have a revolving door between them and big  business, but sanctioned lobbying is very difficult and severely limited  in scope. I value that. It is true that most politicians are  Etonian-Oxford wankers but if you want to run for office in Britain you  do not need to do the "fundraising" money-for-favours  it's-bribery-but-noone-cares bullshit so prevalent elsewhere, in DC and  Brussels.  Legality =/= morality and making bribery legal does not make it not bribery.  So, it should be clear that the "Federal European Union" I envisaged  above would involve a great deal of reform towards transparency,  democratic legitimacy and a real mandate to its citizens.  At this point I should say that I wish we didn't have this vote, and  somebody else did. If another core member state had this kind of vote  (France, Sweden, Germany, net contributors and economic cornerstones of  Europe), I would be rubbing my hands with glee for months. At present we  have a sort of dichotomy to face.  If we vote to leave, then it legitimises Greece's longstanding wish  to leave. And that is dangerous. The potential for a cascading route  away from the EU would be the only thing that could really scare  Brussels into real reform of the highest level of government. Us leaving  alone, maybe not, but the threat of two or three countries leaving in  quick succession would undermine the European market confidence and  force Brussels to action.   Long story short, if we vote to leave we may inadvertently create the  kind of EU that I want to be a part of. But if we vote to stay, we will  kill all chances of that ever happening.   As many US citizens are painfully aware, even when everyone knows the  system is crooked, if the only thing that can change the crooked system  is the system itself, it will never change. Every US citizen knows  Super-PACs and "fundraisers" are undemocratic legalised bribes. Most of  them know the electoral college is a stupid system. Most every Brit  knows that our first past the post elections where a party with 36.9% of  the vote gets 51% of the seats and a party with 12.7% of the votes gets  0 seats are FUCKING BONKERS.   But if it is up to the party that wins with just 36.9% to change the  system, of course they aren't going to. Same for Brussels. Nothing will  change without major external stimuli.  But Britain leaving would damage the EU. We have the largest  financial centre outside of the NYSE, more oil than the rest of the EU  combined, huge reserves of shale gas, a world famous culture of higher  education and research sector (Oxford and Cambridge are household names  around the world, while Brunel, the LSE and others are well known  leaders in their fields). We manufacture almost as much stuff as  Germany, consume almost as much as Americans do, and are the EU's  primary gateway into both the Commonwealth (includes such tiny  insignificant places as Canada, India, Pakistan, Australia, and totals  17% world GDP) and the USA. Almost all transatlantic internet traffic  goes through Britain. Transatlantic flights. Major shipping ports.  Aircraft carriers and power projection capability. Nuclear Deterrent.  The EU could survive us leaving, obviously, but it would feel us go.  Britain is the fastest growing economy in the EU, and a significant net  contributor to the EU project. So, I don't buy the "we don't care, we  didn't like you guys anyway" and "it hurts you more than it hurts us"  line that European institutions have taken in this debate. Many European  economies are limping by at best, some exist on a knife edge. Those  voices do have a role in this debate, but it should be conciliatory, not  adversarial as it has been.  I also do not trust the mainstream British media on the subject. My  perspective is that the remain campaign has, instead of trying to have  an intellectually honest discussion, made a deliberate effort to muddy  the waters as much as possible. Their strategy has seemed to be "make it  as confusing and difficult as possible to form an informed opinion,  stifle debate, the peasants don't know what they want" because they  don't trust the public with this kind of intellectual decision. A side  effect of the "London Bubble" where those who walk in the corridors of  power think the people of "the North" (ie. not London) are lazy morons  and most of the British people grow to resent politics and politicians  because they so obviously avoid having an honest dialogue when it  doesn't suit them.  It seems to me that the Remain campaign is more focused on confusing  people, and bullying them (Osborne's punitive budget), because they know  that scared people are more likely to vote for the status quo. The  "Most Economists" "This Economist!" "But That Economist!" conversation  seems like an exercise in this type of disinformation. It is reminiscent  of KGB disinformation strategies. Instead of creating one big narrative  that can be exposed, lie constantly, all the time, from different  angles, say conflicting things, confuse people, and generally make it so  that the average working guy who can only keep a passing eye on  politics doesn't have the time to sift through to the truth. So he gives  up and becomes disillusioned, and politicians get carte blanche.  Sure the Leave campaign has run a pretty lowest common denominator  fear-mongering campaign but the only way to cut through the noise is to  have a clear, simple message you can put forth loudly. The leave  campaign has also by and large steered clear of ad hominem attacks, name  calling ("Racist!" "Bigot!") and the relentless social signalling of  the Remain campaign ("I'm so not racist, look how sorry I  am for these people drowning!") which always struck me as an  intellectually dishonest way to try to win an argument without finding  an answer. Ultimately I would have loved a more factually based, simple,  clear set of debates where intellectuals from both sides got a national  stage, but instead we have things like Michael Gove taking questions  from a crowd. Slimy, dishonest people who see this as a proxy to advance  their careers are leading the national debate on this, as are newspaper  editors (almost always left, hyper-progressive social signal experts  who are just as trapped in the bubble as the politicians). Where are the  informed, calm, mediated debates from people who don't necessarily have  an agenda other than finding the right answers (academics)? Nowhere.  Even the BBC has failed to realise its normal format for shows like  Question Time is unsuitable, and people shouting over each other is why  we have this mess in the first place.  TL;DR  I'm voting out because I don't want to be a part of the EU in it's  current form. I don't think the current EU system is fit for purpose as  it progresses towards federalisation and it needs major reform. The only  kind of stimulus that would instigate that reform begins with a "Leave"  vote. I don't buy the scare mongering on either side, and I accept that  in the short run Britain will suffer to exit. It will not destroy us.  We are wealthy and well connected even without the EU. Meanwhile the EU  is corrupt, and economically flagging. And Brussels has a very weak  mandate to the people of Europe.   Edit: Thanks for gold! 5x wow.

0	That 'Mass Immigration' is about 1% of our total population, and doesn't  account for emigration; Net immigration figures are currently around  335,000 a year, or just under a 0.5% population increase.   For comparison, there were just under 700,000 live births in just  England and Wales. factoring in deaths (cursory search was around  500,000 in 2010) you're looking at anywhere from 150,000 to 200,000  added to the population each year just from births.  So our population is growing by about 0.25% each year from births,  and 0.5% from immigration, of which half is from outside the EU already.    We aren't even increasing the budget for services by this amount in  many areas, and they have been cut significantly in the past decade.  Our services are stretched to the limit because our government lets  companies shaft us financially, export their profit overseas without  paying tax, and then tells us we all need to tighten our belts.  Frankly, the last thing I want right now is those companies gaining  untold influence over our future laws by making the Conservatives, or  any of our current political parties, the ultimate power in our land.
0	The really scary part is that once we are no longer protected by the EU we'll be left with a Tory government hell bent of dismantling our right, protections and social safety nets.
0	Cummings and Johnson are banning words such as "Brexit", "Deal", "No Deal". They want No Deal without Brexit being blamed. Use these words as much as possible online and in real life. They are brainwashing.
1	It’s a straightforward question about whether we want to be in the EU or not and the answer’s no.
0	There's a deep gulf between the right wing hard brexiters in the tory party and reality.

0	It's going to be devastating" – here's how Brexit will screw over British touring artists
0	The EU will remain as the work in progress it is, but I am not that sure the UK will remain as is.
0	It appears that #BorisJohnson is getting cold feet over a no deal #Brexit. We told him and his #Brexiteer friends that it wouldn't work which is why he's having to back away. He'll have to give in over fisheries, free movement and on divergence. It's all falling apart.
0	My view is that it's a huge, colossal mistake
1	Are you still in Europe??? Please get the hell out.of the UE...we dont need a tiny Island like you....Britannia never again will be nothing relevant....enjoy Trump
1	Excellent result! Boris looks like he's going for a proper Brexit as opposed to Theresa May's fudge that was like some kind of French farce or Leonardo Vinci opera. I shall be having a drink tonight to celebrate our victory.
0	Brexiteers are the most ignorant, uneducated group of people I have ever seen. Even flat earthers have more about them. You are all humiliating yourselves and the UK.
1	Yes I agree the anti Brits have done everything and anything to stop us leaving
0	My mate just posted on his FB about him and his dad raising a flag to celebrate Brexit. 🤣 I mean...what is there to actually celebrate? Have I missed something?
1	Many positive messages on here today. Looking forward to a bright future. A Brexit government puts us in the driving seat. #IndependenceDay
0	Brexit itself is clearly a pig's ear driven in part by a rabid anti-EU faction in the Tory party
1	EU youth unemployment is 19.4% yet the Remain campaign tell us the EU is good for jobs. It's a lie.
0	Brexit is and will continue to be lies and fantasy nonsense, blaming the EU and remainers and taking no responsibility whatsoever. Johnson is playing to the domestic gallery, relying on the stupidity of many of his supporters and believe you me, many of them haven't a clue. This was predictable.
1	Hopefully this will give the UK an opportunity to tighten up on and improve their animal welfare laws and regulations. We can be world leaders!
1	They are now beginning to understand what Brexit means to them. They need us more than we need them. Perhaps in retrospect they should have listened to Cameron more and not laughed at the UKs requests.

1	I hope they are required a visa to come to Europe in their holidays
1	Bring on Brexit!
0	The most corrupt, incompetent government in our history has just broken up the country. I'm sure that we should try and blame this on Jeremy Corbyn.

1	So glad they voted to leave. Good job Britan

1	I want a stable country where people from all counties across the UK are heard and not fed scraps from the south. I don’t want to fear that when my daughter has children there’s no room in schools due to overcrowding, or if she has health issues a medical appointment doesn’t take longer than growing a baby.  We should feel safe in our jobs and not feel as though if we’re not willing to work seven days a week, 10 hours a day then someone can quite easily be drafted in from abroad and subsequently thrown on the unemployment pile further straining local economy.  When every Briton lives a suitable standard of life, then my tax money can be spent elsewhere. When the systems put into place – NHS, state schools, housing – are well-equipped and capable of looking after each individual residing in the UK, then we can accept more and do right by others.  We, the little people, or even the big boys that apparently run the country haven’t got full control over what happens, and if suffering a downturn in wages due a weaker economy over trading deals is a price to pay to make the country and its people better educated and in a full bill of health then so be it.  The image of racism is far from true and shouldn’t be used as a smear against the voiceless that live day-to-day with the consequences of the decision makers that reside in a London borough away from real life and constantly roll the shit downhill.  What the writers in a swanky London office or sat at home at a fine oak table with an Apple Mac drinking espresso from Starbucks don’t realise is that the leave voters from wherever they’re from aren’t afraid of rolling up their sleeves and putting in the graft that will make the country great.
1	Excellent result! Boris looks like he's going for a proper Brexit as opposed to Theresa May's fudge that was like some kind of French farce or Leonardo Vinci opera. I shall be having a drink tonight to celebrate our victory.
0	I'm voting remain none of the leave campaign arguments have convinced me to change my mind.  One of the biggest arguments my leave friends have been throwing  around is how the EU is undemocratic and how they can vote on what laws  to pass and we don't get a say but I don't understand how that's any  different from Scottish, Irish and Welsh MPS getting to vote on English  matters (like the tuition fee increase) because we don't have our own  devolved parliament yet we don't get a say in what happens in their  countries.   No one's able to tell me what will happen if we leave because no one  knows, "facts" they've been throwing around have been proven to be false  so it doesn't make their argument look credible.   Honestly at this stage I just can't wait till its over I'm sick of  both sides and I'm sick of a lot of people getting wound up over it.  Just because it's a referendum doesn't mean parliament actually has to  do it, hell remain could win but we could still leave and vice versa.   I just want to get back to normal life without this and the American election been shoved down our throats every day.
0	This is ridiculous. Everyone know that Putin is behind this and probably Princess Meghan as well. They've got a plan for the UK and it doesn't include Europe or democracy.
0	Johnson pretends everything will be wonderful & easy with his catastrophic very extreme Brexit but eventually reality will blow up in his face,
1	As the UK is justly leaving the anti-democratic EU and is formally in the transition period, the argument to remain is empty. That is, remainers are now an extinct species: You cannot argue to remain in something which we are in the process of formally leaving. Therefore, the tribe which used to identify as remainers has split. The remainers which accept democracy are now leavers and those which do not accept democracy are rejoiners (?), or just malcontents, or something along these lines. Taxonomy is at play.
1	Ladies & Gentlemen, and my wonderful friends & family in #TheGreatBritain  NOW,  this FINALLY means something!
1	Keep moving forward Boris. You have 17.4 million people behind you. #BritishIndependence
0	a lot of "leave" voters already admitted to regretting their vote as it was more a protest vote and they didn't think about the consequences.
1	The people voted for the UK to 'leave' the EU and the Oxford Dictionary definition of 'leave' is to "depart from permanently".
1	Congratulations to UK!!!  You now have an Independence Day of your own!
0	Biggest mistake the British have made
1	It will allow a change of economic model from the clapped-out neoliberalism, significant rollback from which is prohibited by the EU. Whether we seize that chance, and which model we choose, is up to us.
1	British and American troops liberated Belgium from the Nazis 75 years ago, and now some globalist in Brussels with assistance from Merkel think they control the destiny of Britain? WTF is wrong with people? Why would any British citizen bow to their lessers?
1	So, Remainers, when do the drugs run out?
0	I have to applaud any MP that displays such passion in defence of their constituency. Brexit is a clear failure with no decent compromise except at the expense of those of us dwelling at the bottom. This needs to stop. May has failed and all others that follow will too.
0	Surely the best way to 'fight back' is to stay in the EU and stand our ground? We've run away. Hardly fighting.
1	Congratulations on taking your liberty back....Britain is the British people.
0	Only took like 4 years tho.
1	HAPPY INDEPENDENCE DAY BRITAIN!
1	You are welcome back when the boomers and the other fools are gone. Stay strong Britain
1	That's the spirit Boris, give them the ultimatum this must come to a close, it's taking up to much of our precious 'road to recovery' time.
0	Urgh, what a shit show from our government. If it helps i'm not merely saying sorry, i'm trying to convince my family in preparation for any kind of democratic process that might reverse the damage i contributed to.
0	Only the British could tyrannically invade and colonise half the world, then leave the EU due to immigration.
1	Good Morning UK! 🇬🇧 It’s Friday 31st January 2020. The day Britain FINALLY LEAVES THE EU! 🥂🇬🇧😃🇬🇧🥂😃🍾
0	It's the year 2819. Today we celebrate the annual 'Brexit extension'. Noone really knows where this tradition comes from, nor what the term 'brexit' means, but as part of the festivities the dumbest man that can be found is given all the power and a blonde wig. Later when the celebrations are over the youths have to clean up the utter mess left behind.
0	Big mistake!
1	"Bye, Bye EU, Bye, Bye..."Fireworks are going off to mark the UK's exit from the EU. Sky News' @kvittozzi is speaking to people celebrating #Brexit in Yorkshire.
1	I feel so happy today, beautiful sunny day and Brits no longer being bullied by the EU! Proud of my nation, and God save the Queen. Great things to come if we all pull together.
0	I think it's a mistake, esp economically
1	What's sad about leaving a Soviet style political entity with unelected and unaccountable officials telling us what we can and cannot do?
1	WE know that we have real democracy in Britain...Thats worth 100 x anything the EU can offer..
1	The EU has never been “nice”. It is a trade and regulatory superpower that is used to getting its own way.The UK is now discovering what it means to be on the other side of the table.
0	Brexit UK, is where the leavers want to nominate a workshy sponger for a knighthood. Nigel Farage.
0	No matter the hardships or faceplants in the future, brexiteers will find other things to blame then brexit because admitting they were wrong would be admitting they are dumber then half the population.
1	As Brexiters leaders promised, UK has just signed 40 new Free Trade Deals and NHS have started to recive the extra £50M per day.
0	Expect a lot of criminals who live abroad, returning home.
1	Frankly I prefer to be dictated to & ruled over by people of my own country than foreign ones. That's Brexit in a nutshell & why I voted to Leave the EU.
0	Why aren't the brits panicking?
1	American here wanting to wish you a happy Independence Day! Freedom and Security by Brits for Brits!
1	I'm in total agreement with Boris... lets just get Brexit done so that we as a nation can move on and concentrate on everything else thats taken s backseat for the last 3 years!
1	Direct democracy at last. Cry Freedom. FREE AT LAST!!
1	In decades to come, 31st January will be celebrated as the day Britain was saved. It took a fight, but democracy has finally prevailed. Happy Independence Day!
1	BoJo go to jail, enrol in a de-clowning programme, don't get let out before you've done yr time, but meanwhile allow terrorists out early onto our streets to kill & maim.
0	RIP UK. You had a good run but it’s done. United Ireland, independent Scotland and maybe Wales, the EU welcomes you.
0	You forgot the latest #BrexitBonus, UK job seekers not considered for jobs in some industries without an EU passport
0	Good luck UK. You're going to need it.
1	They seem to be getting on fine with the EU -> UK talks just fine without Ireland there…you think they could have at least super-imposed Leo or Simon in the photo to help with the election campaign
1	Way to go BORIS! NEVER GIVE UP NEVER GIVE IN! EU is the ENEMY and represents the smug hateful GLOBALISTS! !
0	Good riddance, even if this cutoff was only symbolic for now.
0	I'm starting to believe the best thing would be for UKIP to get in at the next election , we leave the EU and the bastards that voted for them can reap the rewards, more unemployment, more disenfranchisemnet, more poverty and a meaner, sadder England (Scotland having voted to go independent).
1	Stand up to the evil EU GB in not a rule taker
1	Remainers need to get over it, it was an act of democracy, a choice by the people.
1	Stop with all the nastiness towards people who voted to leave and stop putting us all in the same bracket. Yes, there will have been unintellectual scummy people who voted to leave, but I am pretty sure that the same goes for those who voted to stay. We are not all unintellectual brain dead racist idiots so stop with the belittling snidey remarks and grow up.
0	It is a catastrophe: economically, politically, socially.
1	The media kept booking Farage, because he said something. Mainstream politicians refuse to answer questions and repeat the same mindless slogans over and over again. Then they pat themselves on the back because they haven't committed a "gaffe." They don't seem to realise that it is one the main reasons the public despise them.
1	Happy Independence Day to One and All!
1	For the first time in history, Britain has decided to leave on its own
1	I wouldn’t worry much just give it time the EU will collapse especially with the rise of extreme right parties all over Europe. UK has been intelligent in leaving
1	The waters will be stormy in the near term, but with sound navigation, a bright future lies ahead.
0	Making it more difficult and costly to trade is something that helps UK citizens/companies in general?
0	lets see if the uk people can stay out the eu
1	Well done Nigel Farage, the man that started this whole movement to escape the failing EU, thank you.
1	So why should the UK as the worlds fifth largest economy be forced into freedom of movement, regulatory alignment, or fishery access?
0	Don't understand why people are celebrating thousands of jobs have gone thousands too go...prices to rise in the coming years the whole world is a market place and the UK has decided to open the stall in the middle of the pond...🤭🤭 and we got America promising trade deals when no one wants their rubbish from cars too clothes it's no wonder they been trying hard to block Chinese 5g from starting up in the UK
0	for me its easy,  i will not buy anything from England.... Good luck anyway... and hope EU dont give England any kind of deal, they were like a spoiled brat, let them be alone like they want.
1	Independent is a traitor of Great Britain, trying to destroy it by agitating Reamaiers
0	That’ll show all those brexiteers who read the Guardian!!!
0	The UK parliament will be sining that song next year when Scotland leaves the UK.
0	Simple answer, NO WE SHOULD NOT!! The Magna Carta was the foundation of freedom for SOME, so it’s not all it’s cracked up to be. As long as I don’t steal your horse or make a roof out of your twigs… I’ll be OK!
0	UK and EU are already bullied by the US because of dollar and power. Further, Most of the American companies are called upon on the senate and questioned, US spies on allies. And they are threatening to the EU and Britain not give 5G to Huawei. Clearly shows where this is going. It's so funny when they talk about sovereignty.
0	The Myth of Unlimited Immigration - anyone from any EU state can come and live in the UK.  The Facts: European Union citizens do not have the absolute right to move to and live in the UK. They have the right to come to the UK in order to look for work, They have a right to live here without work only if they can show that are able to support themselves financially.  British citizens have the same rights in Europe If you do not have work within six months, and you do not have private income, you can be asked to leave. The problem is that the government has no idea who is living in the UK. But EU law does allow registration of non-nationals. Any non-British EU citizens who stays longer than three months can simply be required by UK law to register with their local council. This is the law in Belgium. After six months they can be required to provide proof of work or private income, or be made to leave.  The cost of setting up and administering such a system would be trivial in comparison with the costs of leaving the European Union. The lack of control is due to the UK government’s failure to make use of the existing rules.
0	Austerity hasn't ended. There will not be 40000 new nurses. There will not be 40 new Hospitals. 20000 'New' police officers is still below pre 2010 levels. No new money for the North. You fell for a great big Con just to get #Brexit done
1	smart move, leaving this dying union.....
1	It is the function of extremely complex and formal rules-based systems to crush the life and spirit out of the lay people under their jurisdiction. The EU are truly the Vogons of Europe and we will be far happier now we are almost free of them.
1	Congrats!!!! Hope this starts a trend! Independence from globalism!
1	They'll be fine, Switzerland isn't in is in the EU. Go ahead look up how good Switzerland is doing.
1	Don't worry about the EU and trade. The world is a lot bigger than Europe.
1	Im so glad we are finally out. The eu is a broken mess. It doesn't  work never has never will time to reforge our paths.
1	Boris. Get it done at the very least 17.4m people onside.
0	it’s almost funny now we see all these videos explaining what brexit will mean AFTER the referendum. almost like no one really knew what they were voting for and believed the side of a bus....
1	We love the people of Europe, we just don't want to be ruled by their crooks. We already have enough of our own to deal with. And we will deal with them: our house - our rules.
0	Brexit is a crime scene. To come together is to accept that. No thanks. You own this. You also own all the chickens that will now come home to roost.
1	I feel that the EU needs to either fully federalise or draw back into a looser confederation
0	most Brits are pretty stupid after all they have a crack head for Chancellor so they will vote yes to out and yes to 3 million jobs going they can always fall back on blaming immigrants for everything when it all goes tits up
1	No flags rule? Sums up the eu
0	The usual Brexiter delusion.
1	Go for it Boris. Get it done
0	Seems like a good example of why not to inject major direct democracy elements into a representative system
1	Hoorah for leaving the economic turmoil that is the European Union!
1	I like what you say Mr Johnson , dont let us down , we believe in you !
1	Make Brittan Great Again
0	Is it not a bit wasteful in a way. I mean the UK leaves so there’s less regions to represent but they keep the posts anyway and continue to spend money the UK is no longer contributing.
0	Compulsive liar #LiarJohnson is calling the transition arrangement to carry on in as if still in EU until the end of the year the "deal" He literally doesn't care that intelligent people know he's lying as long as he can fool enough idiots. #LiarsGonnaLie
1	Why would anyone want to join the EU? If the EU turned into a simple trade union, instead being a controlling government over sovereign governments, then it would be so much better. Until then, cheers to the UK from the US of A
1	They don't want a deal, they want a cash cow to fund their failing dictatorship.
1	we won. britain won. are kids won. true patriots won. time to make britain british again
1	In 20 years time there won’t be an EU to join.
0	I hope to God that this ends well. But in the hands of Boris Farage, I worry.
1	woo hoo, time to put great back in great britain
1	It does make me laugh how they think they are so FREE within the EU. If a country wants to have a trade agreement with us they are told they aren't allowed to. How is that Freedom? Some un-elected Tosspot telling my country who I can and can't trade with. THANK GOD WE'RE OUT.
1	It’s a sham! Pushed up prices everywhere bad for lazy tourism and especially puts up food prices….has huge waste and very inefficient a laugh considering it’s German run…owned….it’s a dictatorship hub
1	why should i, a british citizen, have what i can say online dictated by european mep's or an group of unelected bureaucrats?
0	Congratulations to all of my friends in the UK.  Now you will be able control your own destiny and deside who immigrates into your country and why !
1	Now let’s use this opportunity to integrate with the wider world in trade and cooperation... and NOT use it as a Tory wet dream to rouse nationalistic-imperialist sentiment in the minds of the populac
0	Brexit is madness, most sane people recognise this.
0	The country is not coming together again. We do not accept Brexit. We do not celebrate this fiasco, nor do we see a single opportunity ahead in separating ourselves from the EU and the wider world. Remainers are now rejoiners. We're not going away. Our place in the EU will be restored in short order.
1	My country should have done the same! Well done UK
0	In all of this campaign I haven't seen an argument for why I should vote to leave. Why would leaving be an improvement to the current situation?  We will re-nogotiate a trading deal with Europe - Already have one so no improvement.  We will save c£9bn we pay to EU - Total government spending is c£700bn, I can see the saving is a benefit but not a big one in the national scheme of things and I'm not sure that leaving won't end up costing us at least that in uncertain inward investment.  Border controls - In my experience being able to have people move around EU (both in and out the UK) has been a great benefit. Many businesses I have worked for and with have seen this ability as a positive. Making that more difficult is a negative in my eyes (plus evidence that tax take > spending for immigrants)  Sovereignty - We already have that and the bits we have pooled with the EU are beneficial. I haven't seen an argument which details how the UK will be better by taking back our sovereignty 100%  I'm happy to read more about it and I'm open minded but the leave campaign have completely failed to sell me a positive reason to change.
1	The British have chosen liberty with Brexit and can congratulate themselves every day.
1	Defeated in two UK elections, a referendum and one US election. Now we have Brexit and Trumps impeachment is about to fail. Liberals are specialists in failure.
0	feel so sorry for the younger ppl in Britain cause the ones who voted brexit were mostly old people from small english villages.  A lot of my friends there are frikkin livid that they'll be deprived of this EU citizenship they've had their whole lives with all the customer protection laws and opportunities for travel & work abroad - particularly the ones in Scotland.
1	You are incredibly naive if you believe in unification and should study haplogroups.
1	The UK should do everything in its power to undermine and undercut the bloc. This will ensure its demise and once again our great nation will save Europe from tyranny.
1	lmao why people so pressed , like EU think they own UK , wtf?
1	What planet are those 382 remoaners on who blame LEAVERS for the Brexit division ? Are they going to blame the LibAntidems for the tories getting an 80 seat majority ? probably. The refusal to accept a democratic decision taken by the majority of the people of the UK caused the division and there was only ONE group who caused that and that was the antidemocratic REMOANERS.
0	The brexit case was always based on talking rather than facts and evidence.
1	Finally, a country with our own democracy.
0	Treason May tweeted: ‘…we can finally say that we have delivered on the result of the 2016 referendum and have kept faith with the British people. Two-faced, hypocritical, duplicitous, deceitful. That doesn’t even begin to describe this dreadful woman…
0	Bye bye EU. Bye bye Scotland. Bye bye Great Britain. Hello Little England.
0	Obviously the British people did not vote for what's happening now. They were given a ton load of misleading information and the Russians got in the muddle.  Why is no one talking about a new vote? Seems to be their only way to get out of this.
0	Not just economically. Britain is diminished in every way by Brexit. There are simply no benefits unless you are a rascist, a disaster capitalist or tax avoiding billionaire
0	And Putin gets another win in his book.
1	Deranged lies. The UK is growing faster than France or Germany, despite the lies that they would be in a depression after the vote. Try to grow up.
1	if we fail due to sanctions it will be blamed on brexit and used as a pretext to justify the EU's existence.
1	we all HATE the EU, it is not a nation, it is not a people , it is a soulless corrupt power. Gone with you!
0	This is the beginning of the end for the UK union.
1	They shall leave. They are too “empiristic”. They think that they are alone. Keep them alone. This is, when one doesn’t fit into a group.
1	Time will tell if Brexit is a disaster or success. The UK has jumped off the cliff, now we will get to see how fast they can flap their arms to fly.
0	Stay focussed brexiteers now is the dangerous time make sure it’s a real brexit not Brino
1	Just like a Dali dreamscape, the EU is melting down, down, down...….it was all a bad dream.
0	I'm an ashamed English person. I'm disowning my country
0	As a historian I fear Brexit could be the beginning of the destruction of not only the EU but also Western political civilisation in its entirety
1	Satanism is our only hope...
1	Everyone forgotten how we stood alone in 2 World Wars.
0	I am voting #remain because I want my Britain back. A creative, generous, tolerant place. #strongerin
1	The bosses,bankers,Obama,Blair and Cameron want the UK to stay in.. Enough said! Time to set ourselves free, Vote Out!
1	Were British once again...not Europeans...at last
1	So glad we voted to leave
1	Goodbye and good luck to the super state.  I look forward to being friends, but no longer part of the project.
1	Is the UK still Safer in after the #BrusselsAttacks http://bit.ly/IsUKSaferIn #Brussels #Brexit
1	Britain has no reason to abandon its standards. But it should not be dictated to by micromanagers from Brussels who don’t have a clue about industry (financial or otherwise).  London is a financial services hub. If the EU want to cut their own nose to spite their face it’s up to them.
0	Fuck #BrexitDay
1	congratulation UK,,,come on build new trade in CPO industry with indonesia...
0	The Brexit will be meaningless and we’ll all have our nuts taxed off. He’s been on holiday longer than he’s been PM in this term but I’m already over him.
0	Now Boris Johnson is PM... Oh Boy
0	Brexit, is beginning of economic cold war between E.U and U.K, Africa is the Battlefield
1	A great achievement for democracy and liberty. The EU is a zombie now
0	BREXIT WILL LEAVE BRITAIN POORER
0	In our opinion, Britain can find a lot of resources and economic aid in the EU and above all, it could also be an economic aid for us. So in conclusion, leaving the EU would be a big mistake for the UK and a great loss for the EU member states.
0	I hope it fails and the UK has to go back
0	Unhappy Independence Day for us 48% that knows this is one big mistake Brexit. Celebrate today you regret it later
0	Few of the issues we have as a country will be fixed by leaving the EU.
0	No Deal is better than a bad deal
1	finally, an actual leader who puts our country first. we weren't asking for much really
1	Congrats GB. You are free again.
0	Big Win Day for Putin. Democracy on a stretcher/his stooges victorious in America..the E.U., and Britain, weakened for decades by Brexit.
1	Does this mean i dont have to watch the eurovison song contest anymore. YAY
0	It seems that Brexiteers are living in their own, PARALLEL UNIVERSE! The EU is 12X BIGGER than the UK! Who do you THINK will dictate terms of TRADE??
0	Good luck to you!...It's going to be rough out there alone!...Today's World,people should stay together,it's a survival thing!
1	Europeans are amused how easily the British public have the wool pulled over their eyes.
0	A small island off the coast of the largest and most successful trading bloc in the world has decided to "go it alone".  Sounds like a recipe for disaster to me.  How has this been allowed to happen?
0	I don't think it's a good idea, personally. There's simply too much red tape, and UK citizens are bound to feel an awful lot of pain if this goes through.
0	Britain is going to be fine. Can't say it's looking good for you though BBC, better start firing off those CV's and look for a new job now because we have had enough of the BBC.
1	The darkest day for Britain since Suez.
1	Good luck GB, be great again!
1	Anyone who wanted to stay in the European union should emigrate to a another country that has remained in the EU theres plenty more of them
1	after the blip in our democracy in 1975 we are back on track as a free nation and  democracy. now we need to fight against political correctness and get free speech back
1	I'm a happy Leaver. Anyone else?
0	This is total lunacy. They just shot themselves on the foot. They will regret it.
1	A good night had by all at the Brexit Celebration last night in Parliament Square!
1	Brilliant news, cant wait for Britain to be fully independent 👍
0	To the caretaker: Thanks mate for doing a great job keeping the City tidy! We really appreciate it! (Sincerely)
0	For those Brits who got their wish, I hope you get exactly what you feel you deserve, no more, no less. For the rest, I wish you the best under your new circumstances, especially those in the fields of science and technology who thrive on collaboration and cooperation. No nation is an island, not even the U.K.
0	“Until this moment, Johnson’s life and career have been a kind of monument to wishful thinking
0	Day 1 of the campaign to join the European Union
0	NOTHING HAPPENS. and that will be the problem.
0	It is a mistake economically. That is obvious. Short and mid-term it will be very harmful and already is. The international reputation is already in tatters.
0	We have lost our freedoms and we always were independent.   You’ve stolen the opportunities and rights of the young generation that you yourself were happy to throw away.
1	Congratulations to the British people!
1	We’ve escaped the asylum, I can’t tell you how good it feels. Straight jackets off, face masks off, we can breathe again
0	Brexit is what happens when a false sense of superiority combines with a false sense of victimhood;
1	I am still a Leaver
1	As a European who studied and worked in London for a total of five years with many friends on the island, I am bloody proud of the people taking the stand for Brexit. It is a great part of getting the Sovereignity back. I can only hope that my country one day will take the same decision. You have defended European countries and shedded blood in two disastrous wars for freedom. You are now taking a stand against EUSSR. You are too big to bully!
1	The EU provides no surprises. The UK should just withdraw.
0	Freedom is good.  Enjoy!
1	Nice. Time to make Northern Ireland part of Ireland.
1	I was in favour of it.
0	There will not be any going back in the foreseeable future. Britain will have to obey the same way as Norway and Switzerland to get access to the singel market. All other thoughts are just wishful thinking.
0	Johnson also relies on a gullible and stupid population, let's not beat around the bush Brexit couldn't have succeeded otherwise.
0	I'm not going to cry if companies leave the UK because they can't afford to pay British people livable wages. Not everyone wants to live 6 to a 1 bed flat
1	The EU seemed to grasp No Deal was about to actually come.
0	#independentscotland
0	I think the EU is worth it but needs a lot of work
1	The EU can go whistle, the more competitive we are, the better for us, and after the way they've treated us, I personally don't give two hoots how hard it is for them!
1	Good for you, Boris, apart from a few hard cor remainers, the nation is totally behind you. We did not leave the EU so that they could continue to tell us what to do.
0	If they do not want to respect the rules and the standards of the single market, the more distant, of course, they will be

0	Basically Brexit was a big waste of everybody's time
0	A lot of my freelance work comes from EU countries ... So what do I do, move to Scotland ? Or change nationality ...
0	They will pay a heavy price for listening to the lies that brought them to this.
1	FREEDOM!!
0	It's provable reality that Brexit is a huge mistake
0	He replied that he had voted Leave at the Brexit referendum because he wants what’s best for England. For England. He voted Leave because of ENGLAND. Then ask me why I support Scottish independence.
0	Just a really bad idea presented as a good one by a bunch of power hungry liars and that is all I have to say about that.
1	I think it's going very well. I've already noticed more police on the streets, & the 40 new hospitals they've built are great!
1	they forgot that people see how the rest of the world is doing outside of the eu  and the true brits wanted to be part of that not bogged down in an eu system that is undemocratic corrupt and seen to be failing
1	We'll get around to teaching remoaners how to get their heads out of their arses.
1	The media are also very bitter and hurt by the leave vote because they did their level best to get a remain vote and failed miserably - so you can understand the outpouring
0	All this "They need us more than we need them" BS will quickly unravel as the UK becomes a basketcase economy where many wont be able to afford a new car, import duties or not.
1	No one gives a shit about Europe and this will be reflected in the turnout.
1	As no deal seems almost inevitable, (I hope), we can take comfort from the billions which have been spent preparing for that very thing, and the thousands of man hours spent on either side of the channel. It will not be as bad as feared. We have survived much worse! Three day weeks, electricity rationing, 27% inflation, Tony Blair, etc!

1	hopefully this vote will have exposed all the Anti-English people currently residing in England and reaping all the benifits this country offers while spewing their hatred for everything British
1	An earthquake would be appreciated in the heart of Brussels to raise that SHITHOLE to the ground preferably with the EU leaders in IT
1	Without our EU budget contributions, we could give everyone a 60 per cent council tax cut
1	Woohoo we are free from EU :D I hope we get buddy buddy with Australia, I love Australia oh and America oh and cananda
0	Big big mistake..
1	The EU have no right to tell us how we should trade with non EU countries
0	Nothing about the referendum has made me quite as angry as Welsh people wanting to leave the EU.
0	VOTE REMAIN
1	The first of many countries to leave once they all watch Britain's wealth and economy explode and problems dissolve.
0	I know two people who voted in 2016 for BREXIT have since died. Why should the current population suffer the consequences? This is not democracy it is stupidity.
1	Boris and Nigel are the most respectful pimps ever.. Hope they can save the holy country of England. 🇳🇱 Much love from Holland
1	You can fish somewhere else Mr Commission er but in the UK waters or tell your fellow countrymen to change there diet
0	Proud to still be European (for now) Ashamed by the behaviour of the Brexit Party MEPs
0	Because Brexit is objectively a bad idea.
1	Just because you say that you can’t think of a good reason for Leaving, that doesn’t mean that there isn’t one.
0	European its just good on the paper and when they speak but action are far away of that :) like Farage say : We love europe, we just hate the european union ! <3
1	Well done UK free of EUSSR
0	it's almost as if leavers had absolutely no plan at all lmao
0	Noo stay i want to stay in eu
1	Just in case anyone in #Folkestone & #Hythe might be unsure where @UKLabour stands on #Brexit here's a fairly definitive statement by one of their own candidates on that  I love fresh frosty mornings. I wish everyone a happy day  #VoteBolton #independent #proBrexit #GE2019
0	I don’t know what I can say to really express how sad and angry I am today.  Rights are being wrenched away on the basis of fraud, lies and law breaking.  So honestly, the #Brexit architects can stuff it where the sun don’t shine.  #StillEuropean #forevereuropean
1	Respect to you Brits!!!
1	Not so much Johnson's glorious revolution as a glorious heist. Now Brexit is over the line, isn't it now time for oppositimistic
0	The worlds gone crazy haha, we are one big meme
1	God Save our Queen, God Save the British, Vote leave. advice from Canada.
0	Democracy is under attack: They lied, cheated & broke the law to win the referendum. Funnelled £Millions into pro #Brexit propaganda ads. Now they restrict access of the press to government briefings. This is an Orwellian nightmare! #FreedomofthePress
0	There will be a lot of very dissatisfied brexiteers within 5 years once the reality hits their miserable life's that nothing has improved and they are just poorer which is even admitted by their own governments assessments. Happy brexit suckers
1	Isn't it amazing that you have accomplished in such a short time what Theresa May couldn't in years. You could tell she never supported #Brexit and didn't care what Brits wanted and voted for.  Same in US with Democrats. Only President Trump has kept his promises. Why we love him
0	Freedom for UK. to make it’s own decisions.
0	We may be strong economically, but so is Chipping Norton, and no one would suggest they could survive as an independent entity.
1	Very happy for them !!
0	In every Brexiteer comment I read, I'm sensing panic.  I think most of them realize they did something very very damaging to the UK but, in true human nature, are now hell bent on pretending they didn't.  That is why there is so much abuse being thrown at those who did not vote for Brexit.
0	The bottom line is I trust the EU to tell the truth and act honourably during these negotiations more than I do my own government. And I suspect I’m very much not alone in that depressing situation.
1	the EU is too old. all they are doing is slowing down the inevitable. leaving this union doesn't mean a new, more modern, one wont emerge.
0	Fuck Brexit and everything it stands for.
1	Other than that the EU is quite flawed
1	It's so famous for being probrexit that it's even started a turn of phrase for all those dizzy shouty red faced old gents who believe anger makes up for lack of knowledge.
1	Free to set our own laws, Brexit should act as a catalyst for a new era of prosperity for an outward-looking U.K. ambitious in removing barriers to trade, enterprise and economic growth.
0	Brexit makes the UK a small, isolated, insular place with reduced influence. That must attract certain elements of the Republican Party.
1	Have you distanced yourself from all the racist remoaners? Because if you did you’d be a very lonely badger.
0	From a different perspective, I am a Welsh nationalist and will be voting to  Remain because Wales would be on the brink of an economic collapse if  we leave the EU. We get significantly more out of the EU than we put in,  purely financially, and I have no faith whatsoever in the UK Government  to replace that funding. We get so much out of the EU because we have  some of the highest poverty levels in the whole of Europe - the  London-centric UK Government seemingly has no interest in rectifying the  structural reasons for Wales' poverty and poor economic performance.  Alongside that, I think the EU is fundamentally a force for good in  the world. Freedom of movement and a peaceful, stable Europe are two  achievements that cannot be underestimated, and although I do not agree  with everything the EU stands for (TTIP, for example, is a nightmare) I  want Wales to play its part in it.   Regardless of the way the UK votes on Thursday, my long term aim is  for Wales to be a Member State of the European Union in its own right.
1	Do you know how much the EU cost me? £13 a year. Admittedly, that was when my pay was 17k. £13 for the countryto freely trade with the other European nations and get preferential terms with other nations.
0	I've been asking those people I know who voted for Brexit almost every day now for the last three years, to give me just one practical example of how their every day lives will be better as a result. I'm still listening to their silence.
0	I would have preferred not to leave the EU, but Brexit is happening, so we need to accept it. Like it or not, we are all in this together now, and continuing to note the probable negative outcomes isn't helpful at this point.
0	Bye bye tv licence fee.....
1	Give the EU nothing!!!!!!!!!!
1	England got along fine for a few thousand years without the crime ridden eu...so the sooner every country exits it, the better.
1	Leftists be like:  "Nooooooo!  Why?  How dare the UK choose sovereignty instead of leftist servitude???  They must be punished!  Let's wish them bad luck!"
1	This propaganda against nation states is based on a fallacy. It was not nationalism that caused the war; it was fascism.
0	We are still Europeans they cant take that from us sad day
0	I think the clusterfuck of the last 3-4 years is proof enough why they *shouldn't* be independent.   But they made their made, time to sleep in it.   And honestly, the Brits have been getting a little fucking uppity lately, so perhaps a nice humbling embarrassing experience is exactly what they need.   In the end, I hope they come out OK. But I know in the interim they're in for a shitshow, and they have nobody to blame for that but themselves.
1	They really aren't trying to let us part on good terms. How can anyone negotiate a deal with someone like this
1	why would we want to stay? The eu has done nothing for Britain.
0	let's see for how long those people will celebrate in UK
1	This is a biased and narrow view of us leaving the EU, why not report on the great foundation that us leaving will produce. I think you have got an incorrect name for your Channel, no way should you be reporting on 'Global' News!
0	Just wait for companies to pull out of the UK
1	Sounds about right for the EU. Talking a load of crap.
1	Great Job Boris!!! The world is rejecting the far left socialists.
0	"We are listening to the British people" - It was actually only 51.9% of them who voted for this, respect the other 48.1% who voted to stay.
0	... It's won the battle, but hasn't won the war. This lady got her idioms messed up.
0	it will tear up international arrangements for trade, flow of capital and ease of travel and require endless fresh negotiations to re-establish anything like the access we have now.
0	As was said at the time of the referendum, the people were lied to, inflamed with migrant issues............!!! In consequence we have shot ourselves n the foot!! Don't blame the EU.....the blame lies squarely with the instigators: Cameron-----a woeful decision to call the ref., purely to keep the Tory Party together, Farage, Bojo, Gove, and May and co. for perpetuating the diabolical shambles!!
1	Good. The British don’t need a bunch of other countries telling them how to run their nation.
0	Good stuff. Good exposure.  But how is leaving the EU goung to help? Some farmers etc receive subsidies from the EU. The people to blame sit in public service jobs from bureaucrats to MPs. Snouts in the taxpayer trough.  They realise the lies at least, a bit late. "Get out, repair the country" ..... Fair enough. Leaving the EU will not solve the UKs demons which centre on class system and massive inequity. These people need to have a good look at Mogg Farage and Johnson. These people are rich and disingenuous, scum.  I understand the disillusionment. Terrible.
1	congratulations England for Brexit, well done Johnson:)
1	Control of our own Laws.
0	voted leave worst mistake of my life and I`ve had a few
1	I am very happy for the UK and hope soon EUXIT! We don't need the EU for import or export... and everything is coming from China, haha We don't want mass migration... and more then 60% where against the EU but pushed their EU into our throat... And their wet dream is to set up an army to fight against Russia... They don't like peace, they only like your money, haha
1	Congratulations to all the British folk out there!
1	Happy For you Uk!! Much love from America!
1	I will vote leave. True, our economy will suffer in the short term, but the EU has been  wallowing in deep economic trouble for a while now, and it still has not  recovered.  I honestly could not care less about immigration.
1	When the UK leaves others will follow. The EU is dying.
0	Fasten your seatbelts everyone you're going to need them.
0	Trying to see the positive in Brexit. All I’ve got so far is that whenever anything shit happens because of it we get to shout “SUCK IT UP. YOU WANTED THIS” at Brexiteers.
1	UK will take back evrything that belongs to UK
1	Finally. :)
1	It constantly smears Eastern Europe
1	I enjoy the tears of many remoaners, this is a small victory that will not change anything, but hopefully this vote will have exposed all the Anti-English people currently residing in England and reaping all the benifits this country offers while spewing their hatred for everything British.
1	Now boris stop partying about brexit get these wild dogs put to sleep bring back the noose
1	God bless America and God Save the Queen and God Bless Boris Johnson The UK can finally have their full potential unleashed and they finally have their full sovereignty back! #AngloSaxon by ancestry #American by birth #BrexitDay
0	I would have voted to stay - purely for selfish reasons (stability keeping £ stronger and I like the option to live and work in Europe without visa).
1	I am English first, British second, And European as a distant third
1	Congratulations to all British patriots who stopped the expansion of European Communism 👍
1	We make more medicines in the UK than the whole EU, including France.
1	Brexit could bring us more money and less loss.
0	So happy brexit finally happend, now kick those scum bag Islamic terrorists out of the country!!!!!!
0	Nothing but lies from the fascist right as usual.
1	Exactly right, we've won one battle but there will be many more to come. It's no time to relax our guard.
1	“We want a thriving trade and economic relationship with the EU. So long as it's under our rules and not theirs.
1	Everyone keeps saying it’s going to ruin their economy but have we seen that happen yet? I’m curious to see what actually happens as opposed to what people want to happen.   The EU seems to have a lot to lose by losing the UK.
0	Let’s see how many hundreds of hospitals, thousands of extra police, hundreds of £m of income we were promised we’d get.....I’ll be happy with a public holiday!
0	I like how you're comparing Brexiteers to drug-dealing university rejects. And we all know xenophobic drug dealers are the worse kind.
0	Shedding a tear tonight and keeping a candle lit in the hope UK may eventually rejoin EU.
0	that's what they deserve, brexit was arguably the worst decision made by a nation in the past decade
1	So stupid to vote Brexit We need those migrants in our hospitals and other places. Those migrants helped out economy as well and now we have to let them go and people will charge much more for doing regular jobs.
0	The sun has definitely set on the empire...Btw 1:10 was childish
0	As far as Johnson is concerned brexit is now all about avoiding scrutiny at any cost
1	Good old Nige! Top bloke! We all owe you bigly, Nige!
0	So the Brexiteers have won and the UK has lost and now it is time to look forward to what will be coming. Due to the extended negotiating phase and the soft landing in the transitions phase, companies can relocate to the continent at an orderly pace. That is good news for those with stocks such as pensioners and bad news for those depending upon a job for their living. Not surprising, it is thanks to the old age pensioners that this is coming about, but who would have thought that they would be capable of so much selfishness.
0	#brexit  What do we know  Defence speading slashed  Council budgets cut 5% Rail fares up 3% BBC license fees up £3 BBC staff cut 450 to 500  Johnson on a No Deal  Working on WTO rules  Where is the Brexit Bonus ? People told they would better off  and they voted Total Brexit
1	As this glorious event sinks in....it is wonderful to hold our heads up high and pronounce we are a Proud Nation again! Whatever the future holds, it will be a future that is decided by the citizens of this "now again" Great Britain! Our grandparents will be proud!...their legacy is secured!
1	Well there’s a surprise, Lammas stoking up the fires with nothing but lies. Simply twisting the facts to suit his narrative. No mention of Boris saying most will be better than the EU’s. Why would we still take rules from the EU now we’ve left? You’re ridiculous.
0	The Guardian should take their share of the blame. Instead of engaging with the actual concerns of the working class, you lectured them about how immigration is an unalloyed good and castigated them for being racists. Now look.
0	Before you vote, just ask this. If we leave, will we have the same freedom to go in to France and destroy the bars of Marseille
0	Can't wait for Scotland and Northern Ireland to secede and get their due independence from the UK. Next few years will be an absolute blast.  I wonder how much less than the € the pound will be worth. Less than the dollar, quite possibly. Good Times.
1	Sack every one of the remainers
1	The more inward looking the EU become, the more they will stagnate.   The sooner that the UK adopts a trajectory away from the EU orbit the better.
0	I sense the column of ones that benefit is rather more limited in scope to the column for ones that won't: "There will be an impact on business one way or the other, some will benefit, some won't," he told the paper.
0	They were too frightened to let us have a second referendum because they knew they would lose hands down. Why leave our European friends?
0	Fear and anger whipped up a bogeyman that directed attention from the real problems. The EU was not perfect but there were benefits to being a member. Issues did exist but not the ones most people complained about. The issues most people had could have been fixed by our own government and the ones they were not concerned about could have been fixed while remaining a member of the EU. People are generally not interested in bureaucracy though, it is also easier for those in power to shape the country without EU supervision. It was easy for the media to manipulate people as a result. The pubic got what it thinks it wanted and those in power got what they really wanted.
1	Final Goodbye to EU, Brexit is complete. British celebrating their modern #IndependenceDayUK.
0	2 days, 2 months, 2 years.......it will still be rubbish. I can’t wait for the day when this Government crumble and die!
0	Start the petition to change the name from Great Britain to Little England.
1	There's more opportunities in my arse.
1	the EU don't want a deal it's clear to see no matter what we propose the EU will block it it's all about land and the 39billon the dictatorship will not agree to eneything
1	The EU still thinks it has control over us. It's laughable!
0	Leaving the EU now being a given, Johnson is right to seek a radical break. It's a bet that the thing up ahead isn't an iceberg, just a wall of fog you can drive through.
0	This whole fucking mess is due to the tories putting party before country for the past 5 years.
0	Brexit is and will continue to be lies and fantasy nonsense, blaming the EU and remainers and taking no responsibility whatsoever. Johnson is playing to the domestic gallery, relying on the stupidity of many of his supporters and believe you me, many of them haven't a clue. This was predictable.
0	Taking back control From Brussels  and handing the control to Trump and Washington
1	Victory for Freedom! As I have been asking for years, we must now have the same referendum in France and EU countries.
0	You blamed the EU for misspending like this, paid for by austerity. It was always the Tories...
1	I wonder what language they’re speaking at the EU today!
0	I’m British and now depressed
0	Welcome to England, (Scotland and co. soon to go) the land of clever little tax free zones, rampant poverty, not very much to sell and not very much money to buy.
1	This is a momentus day. I have longed for this day for decades. I have been considered extreme or naïve or culpable of wishful thinking over the years as I foretold the UK exit from the EEC / EU one day and our rejection of the Euro. I am still considered all those things by some for anticipating the final collapse of the EU / USE one day.   Mark my words, this is a great day for the Western world and the 21st century. This is the day when the 20th century is finally buried. The old certainties of European dominance, of bigger is better, of regulation over flexibility are gone. In the future nations will have to be fleeter of foot, educate their populations to adapt not adopt, be ready for the technology and natural changes that will shape our environment (both physically and culturally).    The UK is back in business. The world is our oyster and the world is welcome to trade with us, engage with us, live with us and be our partners and friends. We welcome those who wish to have sanctuary here and who are willing to abide by our laws (and not import their own). We welcome those who wish to trade with us. We welcome those who wish to seek friendship and mutual assurance against those that would wish us ill. We will stand by our friends and guard against our enemies.   We will help and assist those who find themselves in trouble, particularly those in the EU in the years to come as that crumbling edifice finally gives way. We will help as we did in the centuries gone by and we will gladly do so, for we know that to have a strong Europe is to have security for our islands. We do not wish to see an undemocratic, fractious and politically extreme Europe.    God Save the Queen and long live the UK
0	England gas "NO" economy other than the financial sector......Laundering Dirty Easter Europen money doesn't make an economy
1	Great job UK. Globalism is a failed idea. The world is safe when all nations are strong prosperous and self dependent
0	There are 3 million EU citizens living in the UK who are still qualified to apply, and may be sick of being discriminated against.
1	Well done UK.  You still have the bulldog spirit, sense of fair play and love of freedom.  As an Irishman I admire you all.
1	Can't wait to be free from 3rd world England
0	In case anyone has forgotten the claims made by the leave campaign. The lies for which we have sacrificed our and our children’s rights as European Citizens.
1	We didn't loose Europe , we fought tooth and nail to get out.
1	About time. The lefty tossers will read Marx verbetem.
1	Congratulations!!! 🎊🎉🍾 today u finally exit from EU
0	Brexit has suckered millions of people into a situation where: -a UK government has wasted
0	It's like someone wanted to simulate the confusion and [shortages](https://apnews.com/3a9d922f6fb14049af6c0abe042f316f) of war without the shooting. It's like an inverse Dunkirk evacuation.
1	Good for England! I'm really glad to see they followed through. Anything that makes leftists cry and scream and throw a fit is a wonderful thing.
0	The aim of Brexit is to divide the UK. And to a lesser extent divide Europe.
1	No Madame! This is no mistake (Brexit) nor is it an error of judgement. This is called democracy and freedom and when those of the EU 27 remaining members get to see life outside of he EU, you’d do better to concern yourself over their departure too, rather than voice your panic in our direction... Bonjour!
1	Thanks, but your a approval wasn't required. ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ´ó §ó ¢ó ¥ó ®ó §ó ¿ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§
0	Did you vote #Brexit to ‘give the establishment a kick up the backside’? Wholly reasonable! You have succeeded. But did you really vote for this? Did you give a mandate for this debacle? Time to Rethink? #FinalSay
1	finally! about bloody time!
1	Why on earth should the British compromise with French fishermen when the French have built camps on their North coast to facilitate and encourage illegal immigrants travelling to the UK.
0	For British citizens the British passport is the only one option for travel abroad. British passport is no longer recognised as EU travel document. You will loose all rights over EU and that is the decision of British people. They decided to become 3 party citizens to be independent.
0	How strange that the conovirus hits UK the day we live EU. Punishment for our stupid decision, perhaps? Half of us will die now.
1	Yipee we're out.
1	The EU is no a democratic democracy. No more to be said.
1	Ill be Voting Out.
1	We did quite well before we joined the EU with the Commonwealth. We never did like to be dictated to and that’s what the EU is, a dictatorship.
1	make me easy... WTO. World is bigger than EU. Bring back British standards...
1	Congrats Britain, enjoy your newfound Independence!
0	Brexit voters continually misunderstand the complications of #Brexit. They just want less brown faces. Northern Irish boarder is more important to get right. What a mess.
1	The British, like Americans, are like Dorothy with the ruby slippers. We can get back to Kansas. The answer is squeezing the Ruling Class by limiting their money, and reducing government, and it's bureaucracies, where ever they try to expand. Bigger government is not your friend. It is your Ruler.
1	Good for the UK! Self-determination and Liberty is the highest value there is.
0	Nice. Time to make Northern Ireland part of Ireland.
1	Really fed up with all of this we voted out, so let’s just do it
1	The UK economy has been in managed decline ever since Margaret Thatcher was removed. Funnily enough just two years after John Major took control he signed the Maastricht Treaty which locked UK into the EU's scheme of "Ever Closer Union" and (he hoped) membership of the Euro.  Extricating ourselves from the EU morass of stifling rules and can't do's can't come soon enough.
1	The 47 years we have been involved with the EU are only a drop in the ocean when we consider our long history; and to suggest that we are stepping into the unknown is defeatist nonsense. We are merely joining the other 160 odd countries who don't enjoy the' benefits' of EU membership
1	It's the knock on effect for some other countries this will have
0	Yes because cutting ourselves from Europe magically opens up new avenues for trade that weren't already there. /sarcasm Tell me, what opportunities are these? That way I can take credit when I suggest them myself.
0	Brexiteers best start practicing puckering their lips in order to kiss goodbye their last colonies.
0	It is a sign of how far Britain has sunk that anyone would think the lazy, posturing nincompoop Johnson is a serious prime minister, let alone a potentially great one.
0	It's abundantly clear that the UK government is neither competent nor prepared enough to make anything other than a mess out of this given the tight deadline.
0	Brexit: The comedy show that gets better every week.
1	Europe’s nations should be guided towards the superstate without their people understanding what is happening
0	time for Scotland Independence!
1	The Brits don't fit the eu's prissy rule bound attitude and their school perfect like club.
0	I am voting remain, I have swung back and forth a couple of times but now I am solid in my stance.   If we leave Europe there is a chance it will be amazing for our  economy, but why take that chance? Sure this country isn't nearly  perfect at the moment but it isn't terrible, why put our future up to  chance? Stick with what we know works.
1	Malign forces full stop. The same ones behind the destruction of our beautiful planet and all her stupendously fine
0	"What's the best way of uniting Britain following Brexit? The unexpected death of an attractive Royal!"
1	Glad to be out of Europe hope they suffer
1	Freedom of movement should be the first thing we stop!!!
1	I live in the middle of nowhere and get absolutely fuck all from being in the EU
1	The EU may want and have 'Level' playing field. That's in their area. We in the UK are no longer playing for their side. We also have a level playing field... equipped with drainage for dealing with rediculous regulations, unbiased referee's (commissioners) and interference from UE courts. We have also rejoined the World league. We will be champions.
0	So sad!! Everyone is celebrating for their own reason.But they will soon realise the mitakes!!
1	Let's ALL take back our sovereignty from the global Central Banking Mafia!
0	Johnson won't be around when the shite really hits the fan. That's how it usually works in British politics.
1	And so the sun sets on the British kingdom
1	Thank you.. it seemed like it was never going to happen this time last year, I nearly lost hope, we’ve finally got our vote respected.
0	Is it because they think they’re better than the rest of Europe? We’ll see about that. Oh and they are NOT, by the way.
0	At some point in the future it will sink in to even the dimmest Brexiteer that leaving the EU was a big mistake
1	I pray that the brexit will be successful one day.
1	The Guardian is now a full blown, left wing, propagandist rag....
1	The trade deal they can get with the United States will benefit the UK BIGGLEY!!! Well done Brits!!! And congratulations.
0	Yay! Great opportunity for the EU. Thanks to Boris Johnson we will be able to get substandard products subsidized by the UK government. Such a great deal!
1	now start deportation of all those so called islamic refugees forced onto the UK by the eu.
1	That will be the EU breaking in half soon.
1	and yes this great country of united kingdom have helped to liberate europe twice ,so we know only to well what freedom means.
0	If you are in a club you get the benefits from being a member. If you leave the club you don't get those benefits. Get real leavers. Stop whinging - you voted for it.
1	A brilliant new start for the country!!!! Well done Boris!!!!
0	To believe that Brexit will help solve some 'old' problems sounds incredibly naive. Brexit won't bring back industry, it won't lead to high pay, it won't solve the housing issues, it won't lead to investment in infrastructure or the NHS. If these things don't happen when you have a stable economy they are highly unlikely to happen with an unstable one.
1	To be fair, the soft brexit option was never really there so I guess it was always going to be a hard
1	Why cant EU just be a trade union for which UK had actually signed up for?
0	We are just waiting for the old r@ c1sts in the UK to die off, then we can begin to fix this mess.
1	David Cameron simply thought he could re-apply his Scottish Independent referendum project-fear tactics as a strategy for Brexit. Well, he failed.
0	Poverty....welcome in uk
0	I feel like it's a pretty stupid choice that seems like it will only help a select group of wealthy people while hurting most of the people who were duped into voting against their own interests.
0	This Hard Right Tory government can’t wait to Strip us of the Human Rights Act.. they are falling over themselves over the point of being able to do it.. Then they can get away with Murder... over 130’000 Sick and Disabled dead in the last 10 years, think of the number of us Disabled who will be a Target for them if they get rid of the human rights act....
1	The current setup with the Euro is unstable, it benefits some countries more than others, it leads to migration from poorer areas to richer ones.
0	Boris said Brexit was done. It's not really though is it? And it could go on and on and on and on. Never ending talks no less....
0	We will regret leaving
0	The Swedish populist, euro-skeptic and anti-immigrant party "Sweden Democrats" recently dropped their anti-EU stance because of Brexit. It simply became an untenable position to argue for a "Swexit" with everything that is going on in the UK. A few months before that the euro-skeptic socialist left party did the same thing. They are now talking about reforming it from within.   It goes to show how insane the Brexit position has become, that the "allies" are seeing themselves forced to revise their position.
1	So looking forward to seeing the EU27 countries brought to their knees. Roll-on 31st January 2020 at 11pm GOODBYE EU 😊🇬🇧
1	Time to bring back the Empire.
0	Brexit was a fantastic example of a nation shooting itself full in the face.
0	actually how could we live without fish and chips, or sausage sandwiches??
1	FREEDOM, BABY!  YEAH!
1	It's a economic good decision
0	All roads lead to Putin. And he’s laughing his head off at his successful campaign to destroy the western world.
0	Brace for the recession, fellas
0	Brexiters have no idea what they actually do want, just lots and lots of (conflicting) what they don’t.
0	Isn’t it about time that Anglo-European Brexiteers come to their senses and realise we’re all Europeans.
1	It is a real victory against the corporations, the globalists, and the muslims.
1	I can’t think why those behind leave now want remainers to unite, to get on board, make Brexit a success,
0	Many Britons — whether they wanted to leave the EU or remain — were so exasperated by the interminable wrangling that they voted in last month’s election for the politician who promised to get it all over with: Johnson
0	The EU has provided an environment in which the countries of Europe can co-operate and flourish without killing their populations on grounds of nationalism. There is NO greater argument in favour of union in Europe. NONE.
1	Brexit will create many new opportunities.
1	HAPPY BIRTHDAY, GREAT BRITAIN ! Britain is Great Again ! Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday dear Great Britain, Happy Birthday to you ....... and Many Morrrrreeeee!
0	Who do we trade with if we opt out? Because other nations like Australia, newzealand, America, and many Asian, African, and European countries ply their Trade within the EU, Forget all this go it alone, the truth is we need the EU.
0	Like many others In the thread I'm Welsh and plan on staying in Wales  through university. My area particularly has had massive funding from  the EU so I'll be voting Remain. While I don't think that the statistics  can be trusted from either side the Leave campaign has been painful.  Just the fact that Boris Johnson is the figurehead for Brexit is a  massive turn away. Not to mention that the Tories would be given further  political power without EU restrictions. So yeah, I'll be voting  Remain.
1	Everyone who thinks remaining in the EU is good for UK citizens should google "UK companies that has relocated using EU funding"
0	millions of people can't be wrong unless they're british
0	Forever divided, we leave. So sad. To the elderly, I say "We cannot believe you would throw your children under the bus." But you did.We will deal with the mess. Thank you
0	#Brexit is such a waste It is *absurd* that a country is damaging itself irreparably while also costing itself almost the entirety of its EU contributions over 47 years of membership. Unbelievable. People will be writing about this madness for centuries.
1	Congratulations to all of my friends in the UK.  Now you will be able control your own destiny and deside who immigrates into your country and why
0	A year on.  Still no fucking plan for Leaving.  What an achievement.
0	No way am I ever going to fall in with Johnson's and Gove's demand to "come together" behind their Brexit project and move on into a glorious (isolationist or Atlanticist) future.
1	He was also very covertly #probrexit while being overwhelmingly polite. It's good to get out of London bubble sometimes
1	Suck it up BBC haha.
1	Leave. The question I ask myself is this: do I want to live in an independent,  self-governing country where the people are in control of shaping their  own destiny, or do I want us to remain in a corrupt, anti-democratic,  Soviet Union in the making? Former Statesman, Mikhail Gorbachev has come  out and said that "the EU is the new Soviet Union dressed in western  clothes" and I agree with him.         Contrary to what many say, the EU is not wholly about creating  jobs/opportunities and trade for people, it's mostly about power and the  formation of a superstate. A superstate, which like the Soviet Union,  is doomed to fail. Additionally, instead of keeping Europe peaceful as  is so often claimed, the EU is likely to be the cause of the next major  conflict in Europe. Because when you continue to strip people of their  democracy and overrule them when making choices which affect themselves  and future generations, you piss a lot of people off, and you don't need  to be a student of history to know that eventually it will lead to  tension, conflict and even war.
1	One day people will learn, no one wants open bidders but politicians who profit off the poor and criminals. Multi cultural is destructive. Multi ethnic is fine but multiculturalism is a crime against humanity.  If you don't believe in the culture, don't go there. If you believe you're a Mexican then stay in Mexico. If you believe you are an African then by all means, move to Africa. You are what your culture says you are. You're either British and you believe in the British culture or you aren't and therefore you should gtfo. You are either American or you aren't, gtfo. You don't go to a Muslim cultural nation and debased to build a Catholic church so don't come to our nation and debased to build a mosque. #BREXIT!!! Get your own house in order before you start worrying about housing flunkies who'd just as soon cut your throat ads rape your children as to look at you.
1	We as a country that can do so much.... make it a good place for business to flourish, good well paid jobs will follow and then we can sit back and watch the eu scratch around for what's left..... good riddance to the eurocrats.
0	There are some really nasty people in the Tory party. And this guy is one of the nastiest!
0	Our FPTP allows an `elective dictorship’.. It would have been exactly the same if Corbyn and his acolytes were in power.. We have a principle free, serial liar in charge, supported by his enablers in the media who will parrot whatever shite he comes out with next
0	any political leader who speakes about UK leavindg the European Union ,is in fact an enemy of the democracy and freedom.
1	WE WON. WE GOT ARE COUNTRY BACK !! LONG LIVE THE BRITISH EMPIRE !!
1	now merkel controls every aspect of british lives. so what was ww2 all about? vote leave, and make britain great again. canada and australia are doing a lot better than greece and spain.
1	Keep it up Boris
0	Brexit is evil putins project. Feminists and lgbtq must spearhead the fight against putin
0	I smell war in a few years from now
1	Brexit, , while moderately painful to both member's and western economies, at least in the short run, will enable the world economy to better weather the eventual and inevitable collapse of the entire EU structure. Former Czech President Vaclav Klaus has been predicting this for many years,  and every year his data grow more robust.
0	Is Britain leaving ? Where ? To another world ? Lmao.
1	Brexit yes! We are free!....
1	Boris I am with you
0	Sadly the majority voted for the soundbites and had no clue what it was about. Mist I speak with say things like.  Get back our laws.. we had our laws already.. have sovereigncy.. we had it already. Stop EU controlling us... we were a voice in the EU and did control ourselves
0	It's pretty simple what we voted for. We want to live in the EU. We don't understand how can anyone not want to live in the EU?! And now we lost, we are both angry at being dragged out of the EU against our will and even more at the prospect of the country we love being shattered into many pieces over this issue.
0	Staying in the EU is clearly the most sensible thing to do.
0	It’s merely the first steps down a very long path.
0	Brits voted for Brexit for the same reasons Americans voted for trump ... discontent mixed with ignorance.
0	It is easy to blame, it is harder to take responsibility for the future economic growth of a country without any real certainty. We have told our biggest and best trade partners to no longer trust us. We have told our own citizens that they will have to pay tariffs most likely or even duty on imports that they rely upon. "Buy local!" will be the cry, and that may have some good effects but with limited exports and looming disasters on car manufacturing, the economic model is not looking at all well. So blame everyone else and avoid media scrutiny. That should at least ensure the erosion in popularity is a little slower. But in the end, it creates an opportunity for the Opposition to organise properly this time. We will need a healthy dose of reconstruction after this fiasco has played out.
1	Brexit now! We want brexit!
1	how far the British empire has fallen in the EU. this could be the step we need to get control over our country again. it wont be easy and there will be cuts but i think leaving the EU will help get the UK under control again
1	We hope it works out for them. But if it does not, there will always be a seat kept for them at the table
0	It baffles me why people who don't like the Guardian's political views take umbrage at them for having them.  We get it, the Guardian is an elitist paper that doesn't listen to the British people. Thanks for that. Now toddle back to the Daily Mail and Sun websites where you can celebrate the rise of a new Britain with your peers.
1	We want out
0	I never wanted it. I voted remain.
1	The British people have now achieved their ambition to leave the dysfunctional, corrupt, maladministration and undemocratic EU. That gives Britain freedom to take control of our borders, our finances and enable our elected Parliament to create our own laws. Britain has once again become a sovereign Nation. Phase one is now complete and trade negotiations begin. EU bureaucrats would be advised both sides are obliged to negotiate in ‘good faith’ but, remember the well quoted British mantra of ‘no deal is better than a bad deal’ still prevails. With Britain carrying an annual trading deficit of £98 Billion with the EU. That puts Britain in the driving seat.
1	Good riddance!
0	I just emigrated.
1	The UK has regained her liberty, freedom, & Autonomy. Now she can represent her own citizens interests!!!!
0	If you guided it with gold renainers will not no matter what like it! So we go no matter what as soon as we can.
1	The EU need Brexit to fail, so the only viable approach is no further negotiations and Cliff Edge, to concentrate the EU's leaders minds, British troops should withdraw from NATO operations.
0	It would be the saddest thing! Do not leave the EU, we all need to reform it so it works for all of us. Leaving is just a failure for nations of Europe, and giving up a great project, just because some of the politicians manage it badly.
0	Brexit - they thought it was all over! No, that was the easy bit, now the tories face the real test. Can they diverge from EU rules AND get a trade deal? Can they stop border checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK? Can they hold the UK together? Can they find the money for HS2? Will Boris lie down in front of the bulldozers at Heathrow or will he just continue lying? Interesting times ahead.
1	Anyone would think that UK hadn't survived for hundreds of years without the EU. Trade is much more global now and the politics of the EU are anathema to a freedom loving country. Do your worst Globalists, UK will be the first to leave, will it be the last? I think not. Time will tell.
0	I'm wondering what many Leavers think abt this now, especially since a lot more info abt the real consequences is out. Oh, also, since the rich Leavers have been taking their business elsewhere etc
1	UK, how about LEAVE NOW? :D You voted, please act immediately!
0	Leaving a large market will do damage to the UK economy.
0	As the Tories take us out of the EU on the hardest terms, they're risking our jobs, our security and trashing the cooperation of the past 50 years.
0	It means: 1. Recession 2. Loss of economic influence in a global economy 3. Loss of cultural influence 4. The break up of the U.K. Great job Dominic!
0	Eff reaching out to the world. Im voting remain because its pure common sense to do so. If we learn anything from this, it should be less reaching out to the undeserving and more reaching out to our own populace
1	The EU is made up of small nations and nations that don't realize that they are small yet
0	Since when does anyone have any say in that building unless your high ranking and working for the EU get real
1	FREEDOM FROM THE TYRANNY OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
0	I do not think that Boris Johnson can call the shots here.  Trade represents 40% of UK exports but only 10% of EU exports are to the UK.  We will have to take whatever deal the EU is prepared to give us.   Which is why Brexit was such a fundamentally flawed idea in the first place.
0	I 100% am voting to stay. All the expects from multiple fields think this is the right opinion, with intelligent qualified people saying leave being the exception rather than the norm. Leaving will make travelling (something I love) more difficult/expensive and could have major negative economic effects for years to come. I really hope the country makes the right choice when we vote and lots of people do actually vote. There is such a terrible attitude amongst people (particularly young people) that it's not worth voting, which is really harmful.
1	We should insist that the EU follow our rules
0	How could a modern, educated and open society have got it so wrong
0	pathetic... i am saddened and embarrassed to be British
1	One of the saddest day in the UK .
1	Just remember when all those predictions of doom and gloom don't come true that you were being lied to and manipulated. The UK is a great and powerful nation, and it's people are hard working, tough survivors. EVERYTHING will be OK.
1	The UK had hundreds of pieces of legislation from the EU. The EU is nothing more than a Dictatorship, leading us to world governance, world army and world policing. Research it yourselves. The New Workd Order and Satanism.
0	Staying In. Because I trust the EU Commission a lot more than I trust the Tory government. They would rip up any bank regulation within a week and see our consumer and worker rights fed to the wolves on a plate
1	I don't feel comfortable with the idea that people that were not elected by the people of my country can make laws that govern my country and be unaccountable for any effects as a result of these laws. It seems very undemocratic, if not anti-democratic.
1	Boris is going Bald, he is unleashing his potential!
0	So it appears Trump UK is also losing. Let's keep the momentum going and get rid of this louse along with Farage.
0	Britain will return to the EU in 2-3 years. What Brexit supporters know, but fail to admit, is that Britain simply cannot survive outside the EU. Of course, by that time, there won't be a 'Britain', as we know it. An independent Scotland and a united Ireland spell the death knell for the UK, but Johnson and his ilk are willing for those things to happen. England and Wales will return to the EU in 2-3 years.
1	Sovereignty is the only argument necessary
0	Feels so exciting to finally be able to tear up all of our existing trade deals....and then have the freedom to renegotiate them all alone without the backing and market of the most powerful business union  on Earth
1	Everything about the eu stinks rule britania rules the waves
0	A new, creative and hope-giving history has to be invented and created!
1	BBC = FAKE NEWS! FAKE JOURNALISM
0	How can Brexiteers deny the reputation they have gathered since Brexit campaign started, when they celebrate entering in the transition period, where the UK becomes a rule taker rather than a rule maker, as leaving the EU?
1	Vote Brexit Party People!!
1	Funny how it couldn't be done according to Eyore and Treason May. Well done Boris!
0	Im no fan of the EU but Im still voting to remain. I see no benefit in leaving. When you "Brexit" reply. Actually have a valid reasons and don't just spout on about "control" or "immigrants" or just resort to petty nationalism. Thanks.
0	Brexit, tax return deadline, the end of January and Irish passport renewal all in one day is quite a feeling. Like being kicked in the nuts, asked to pay for the pleasure and then given a lolly.
0	The level of Leaver ignorance continues to astound as the clots fail to appreciate that their Commander in Chief is Mr Protectionism when they point fingers at the EU.
1	It is true that some people catastrophize about it but why? Switzerland, USA, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand aren’t in the EU and they are all advanced, prosperous, democratic and civilised places.
1	What is the problem, Boris and his cohorts told us we would get a great deal. They wouldn’t lie surely.
1	3 qualities none of the remainers on here have:  Dignity  Pride  Humility
1	congrats UK. You got it done! Fuck the EU
1	I am pretty sure other countries will do the same to be able to get some good trade deals with the US..
0	Brexit is of no benefit for the vast majority of us.
0	I voted Remain, not just for political reasons but because my mum’s moved to Spain and I want her to stay there.
0	But leaving the EU on the 31st of October with or without a deal will not get Brexit done. You really are a barefaced liar. It is just the beginning of the process, and might I had a process of impoverishing those most in need.
0	The very best deal is a very swift and permanent #exitfrombrexit. We are European and need to remain firmly at the centre of the EU
0	I'm ashamed to be English. I am really starting to hate my country
1	The reality of course is Brexit is far from complete, the crucial phase is only beginning now. And while I acknowledge there is a sense of Brexit fatigue, people will have to stay awake for most of this year.
1	Congratulations to ALL Brits on getting your country back! I sincerely hope other countries follow in your footsteps. The EU has shown to be a failed experiment. It is the 4th Reich, and needs to be ended ASAP.
1	free trade, free movement, free capital, free work with the EU is what we voted against, so let's ot spend time and lose focus in the next 11 months, do Something else. and get out of the WTO which is a similar thing
1	So, the referendum has been fulfilled. We start with a blank sheet of paper.  The battle starts again.
0	Decades of ANTI EU media has brainwashed Brexiteers into the idea that the EU was bad...It isn't Bad but actually benefits UK in a huge way
1	The EU was a bad idea from day one!
1	Nothing more beautiful than a bunch of socialists crying the end of a failed project.... history repeats itself
1	Isn't it great to be the out of the EU? Like having escaped alive from a burning building, we can now watch as it self-destructs from a safe distance.
0	Yeah this will not go good for the UK, we all knew it, pity they are suffering in a similar way as the US under corruption within the government
1	Brexit will be good for Britain. Norway wisely refused European conglomeration. Norway is a very wealthy country.
0	Enough is enough brexiteers are great at talking the talk but not walking the walk. Get a pair of boots that are made for walking we have heard it all before.
0	UK: I'm going to jump of this ship soon. I'm the best swimmer in the world, I won't even get wet, I don't like anybody on this ship and it will sink soon anyway. EU: we don't want you to jump but it's up to you. UK: and we want you to beg us to stay, a life jacket and free access to this ship without having to comply to the ship's rules. EU: actually you still owe us money so you won't get anything unless you pay. We created this ship together and we still think it's more safe than anything we had before but it's up to you. 3 years later: UK: OK, you had lots of chances to negotiate with me but you were not reasonable, I'm going to actually jump off ... and mark my words; if anything bad happens to me I'm going to blame YOU !
1	Congratulations to the UK from the USA
0	This is your chance Europe, show The UK what Taxation without Representation is like for the next 11 months!
0	Boris Johnson is so delusional, typical British. It will be fun when you realise you will have to pay us to trade with the most successful trading bloc in the world. Good luck selling your assets to US. It will be super fun to see you crying because everything was privatised. The common uninformed Englishman truly deserves that.
1	Nigel Farage! Thanks! You’re my hero!
1	I support brexit because it means indepdnece for Britain.
1	I honestly can't stop grinning since Brexit day
0	I can imagine Putin drinking his wine with a happy face because of this
1	Well done Boris, The People's Prime Minister
0	If you happen to be a brexiter, enjoy the moment, because it will not last.
0	Sorry I couldn't hear you over the sound of Britain crashing and burning.
0	My impression is, if it actually happens, it will cause the UK to break apart. I think it's a mistake and it wouldn't surprise me if the UK (or maybe just England &amp; Wales...) asks to rejoin the EU within 10-20 years.
1	Congrats UK patriots for getting your independence back
1	Well at least they have to ask for access to our fishing waters now instead of just taking it. And the answer is No! No! No!
1	Tomorrow night at 11pm the U.K. leaves the European Union...the doomsayers will be disappointed...I remain confident that the U.K. will do well as an independent sovereign state..
1	This is YOUR victory. For once, the little guy won.
1	This is the moment when we really begin to unite and level up.
1	Come on England ! Fight for your farmers and your fishermen. This is what you voted for !
0	Has anyone found the list of real benefits we are going to get from Brexit yet?
1	If your vote choice was based on the propaganda presented by both campaigns, then I can understand why you are upset but you are responsible for the way you are feeling because you have free will and you had the opportunities to do the research as I did and I voted leave.  I for one spent many nights reading and educating myself on the history and foundation of the EU, reading official documents, opinion pieces, FACTS and I am comfortable and proud with my choice to vote leave. I believe that if more people performed unbiased open minded research then the Leave vote would of been higher purely based on the undemocratic and communist soviet style system the EU is based upon. Do the research.  “The most puzzling development in politics during the last decade is the apparent determination of Western European leaders to re-create the Soviet Union in Western Europe.”  Mikhail Gorbachev (I like to think that he would know a Soviet Union when he saw one!)  I actually believe that many people did not pay attention to the fear propaganda and voted based on what they see going on in their own communities. I know many that quickly got turned away from the fear inducing headlines that were chucked at us every day.  It's telling to me that only the major cities and Scotland voted to remain. How many of those remain voters have visited the northern industrial or fishing and farming communities! A huge section of the Greater British society has been left behind, especially in areas where our industry was lost in the 80's. This was a huge factor in the outcome. I fully understand that these industries were replaced by services, tech and science and that the EU was providing a structural fund and I get that but the people in these affected communities obviously are not seeing the benefits or myself and these people would have one less reason to vote leave!  I can see that immigration was a big contributing factor but I don't believe that immigration was the number one issue. I do believe that the establishment media is doing their best to make leave voters appear racist or xenophobic. I actually don't know one leave voter who could be considered racist or xenophobic and I know a lot.  I consider the comments stating all leave voters to be racists inflammatory and dangerous. This type of commentary is what is causing division between reasonable open minded non racist & non xenophobic folk like myself who voted leave.  Please try not to generalise as I would predict that a fair amount of the ignorant people wouldn't have even bothered to vote. I have spoken to a few people who could be considered ignorant and they didn’t care enough to register let alone to vote. I am not trying to say all leave voters are not racist because there is clearly an element but not all who voted leave are like that, far from it in fact. It's fair to say that both sides did not do well on addressing the immigration issue.  I believe that if the remain campaign did a better job of presenting information and statistics to the concerned voter related to non EU migrants vs EU migrants entering the UK then it would of gone a long way to alleviating concerns but both campaigns were so bad that looking back it seems like they both wanted to get out. I think it's fair to point out that I have actually heard a fair few remain voters espouse some pretty ignorant racist comments in the past, unfortunately it is an unwanted part of our culture that sits in both camps I just see Leave voters unfairly targeted because of the direction of the out vote when many who voted Leave did not solely vote based on the immigration issue!  So please be careful not to generalise and paint everyone with the same brush.. The last thing we need now is for this division between camps to extend on because that helps nothing. It’s time to think progressively as one, arguing and mudslinging isn’t doing anyone any favors right now.  I voted for the communities I mentioned above and for what I can potentially see as a much brighter future for the whole country. I considered voting remain to be somewhat selfish and used my vote to speak for who I believe to be the disenfranchised that I believe have been victims of regressive and broken bloated EU now political system. I agree that our own political system is also largely to blame.  My main reason for voting was to retain our democratic system and sovereignty so that generations to come have a chance at living in a free country not run by bureaucrats holding the reigns of power but unelected by the people of this great country.  I voted leave fully aware of the economic consequences. I am prepared to take the hit for independence and to retain the democratic system that although flawed in places it works for the people and not corporations. It works so well in fact that it was exported around the world. Staying in the EU would have meant a gradual degradation of democracy as power gets centralised further into the hands of the unelected few.  Some have said that going it alone is isolationist but I see remaining as being isolated within 27-member trade zone. Now we have the opportunity to trade on a global level. We do need to elect politicians who are capable of securing good trade deals but I am confident that if the EU doesn’t chose to punish in my view unfairly that good trade deals can be achieved because the Great British brand has always been strong and that will not change.  As /u/tedcase pointed out:  "We do not need to be chained to a Eurocentric attitude to trade and relations. We are not turning our back on the EU, we are opening the doors to the rest of the world and we are doing it on OUR terms, not the EU's.  Do you think Japan suffers in trading with China because they have no say in the way China is run? Do you think the USA and Canada are unable to trade with each other because they have separate legislation?  The whole planet trades with the EU (what's left of it) and they can get the best deals that are mutually beneficial for all. Member states cannot. The EU was a cartel, a protection racket at best."  One thing I ask of all of you who have read this is the keep your eyes on the leaders of both parties because they cannot be trusted. We have Cameron (Bullingdon Club), Johnson (Bullingdon Club) and then we have Osbourne also (Bullingdon Club). Now if you are remain then you should probably consider this to be a good thing right! since they are all going to conspire together to find a way to not let us leave and they are already delaying the exit. How anyone can not see a conspiracy here I do not know! I don’t think that Boris can quite believe we had the balls to leave. I am of the opinion that he was put in the leave campaign to discredit it because he is a buffoon but obviously if that was the intention then it backfired because his propaganda as bad as it was it resonated.  You can chuck insults at me if you like! It's water off a ducks back because I am comfortable in my decision and confident that providing we get the right people in power that our future is brighter out of the EU.
1	Happy Independence Day UK as a sovereign nation has much greater potentials than enslaved by the corrupt #EU bureaucracy. Free trade with the US will unleash UK economic potentials
1	I didn’t want leave the eu
0	The end of the world is going to be so interesting
0	I am astounded by the stupidity of the British politicians. About to drive their country off a cliff but people still trust them because JRM has a posh accent?
1	Remainers are desperate for Brexit to hurt the economy to protect their arguments but the fact is that we will likely get free trade deals with not just the EU but many other countries and in the long run can flourish outside. The constant bombardment of negativity from them will not stop anything.
1	What an absolute disgrace. The UK public voted to leave the EU THREE years ago. We should be out.  I thought the UK was a democracy...
1	So excited to see all that extra NHS CASH you promised What an amazing amount of cash going straight to our NHS
0	Boris is at his strongest when he’s waving kippers around to wrongly accuse the EU of creating red tape that originated in the UK.
1	Replace the EU’s bad trade deals with our own good ones.
1	Hahaha, the mainstream media is still refusing to learn! Maybe go OUTSIDE of London and conduct some interviews?? Too scared to get out of their metropolitan bubble to hear opinions that differ from their own?
1	I am an ardent leaver who is so glad Brexit is done, but I am also an ardent believer in the union and cannot contemplate it being broken up by xenophobic claptrap. I am a proud yorkshireman but England did,nt make us great by ourselves, we became this great nation because we are a union, we will continue to be a great nation as we move out into the world again because we are a union.
0	Any British citizens want to enlighten us on how exactly this is going to change things for you? No sarcasm or snark intended, genuinely interested in an actual participant's take.
0	Brexit is a dumb move. Sure, why not leave one if the worlds biggest trading blocs! I’m sure NOTHING could go wrong. Scotland’s got the right idea in trying to leave the uk.
0	Congratulations to all the REMAIN team, Jo would have been proud. LEAVE fans will hopefully act classy in defeat but I doubt it.
1	allow for greater controll with trade with the rest of the world
1	When people stand up and talk about the great success that the EU has been, I'm not sure anybody saying it really believes it themselves anymore.
0	They decided it was better to yell at those pointing out the reality, than acknowledge what was happening around them. The goal posts were moved from glorious future to "it's not a disaster yet".
0	Do you hate or pity Boris Johnson for the dishonesty he has used to get his way on Brexit. Upto 2016 he wanted to stay but then he asked whats in it for me and changed his mind to leave so he would gain at our Country's expense
1	I wanted the UK to leave the EU
1	So long as we leave the EU completely I'm all for it,, just Don't try to keep us in it or there will be trouble for sure,, the EU is finished and is an out dated ideology that's failed 600million people
0	Thank you for keeping the door open. So many are angry at the lies they were told and want to #stay in the EU. Nothing could be worse for the UK than #Brexit. I voted #Remain For my children and me. Please help, #StopBrexit
1	The Brits: showing the world how it is done!! Congratulations from your cousins in the USA!!
0	This is the UK decay
1	It’s beyond my comprehension why nation or citizen of any nation would want someone other then their elected officials to make laws and dictate how a country is run..
0	Today, I am disgusted to be British ... I resent what I thought was a minority in this country, ignorant people, but it seems fear tactics from the likes of Farage and Johnson have convinced people to ruin a future that doesn’t belong to them.  As a teenager living in London, my future, and my friends’ future, has been taken away from us and tossed into disarray by people who are completely alien from the things they are scared of.  Immigration was never the problem, money was never going to go into the NHS, and we’re less “free” than we ever were with the financial and political crash that is happening. And all we can do as the progressive and inclusive youth of Britain is watch our elders destroy what little we had to build on.  Seeing idiots like Farage call for “independence day” as the pound plummets makes me think that we were in a better place before we let bigots decide our future.  I don’t know what to do, I sit here in awe of the place I am no longer proud to live in, surrounded by people I am no longer proud to be associated with. Fear has changed this country forever. I hope whoever voted leave is happy with the turmoil they’ve sent us into.
0	Oh well, being a first world country was good while it lasted.Hopefully the ghost of Charles de Gaulle will let us back in in a few months when everything sucks again.
0	Now Britons will need visa to get into the European countries, as an aftermath.
0	the symbol of huge collapse
0	I trust the EU, I do not trust Johnson!
1	I would love to see the breakup of the EU. Nation states should free themselves from the voluntary shackles offered by cynical, deceitful, anti-democratic, sneering control freaks.  I voted because of the almost insurmountable obstacles to reform in Europe. Other member states, and some of our own representatives, were far too keen on keeping in place the undemocratic practice of appointing rejected leaders to positions of power in Europe. The way the Mediterranean countries have been treated has also been a disgrace.  The initial hit to the economy is going to be painful. I hope it passes as people get a grip on what’s actually happening. Trade is not ceasing, barriers are not being erected, hard-working Europeans aren’t being deported.  I also hope the people of Britain will face the coming challenges united, and bury any ambition of demanding more referendums on previously settled matters. It’s the EU’s way to tell everyone to vote again, not ours.
0	i love his over reaction and disbelief every time someone tells him they will continue to vote for Brexit. Such disdain like they are stupid. The North have been dumped on for years and staying in the EU will only see more British money pumped into Europe and building a terrifying EU Army and not money and a future into OUR northern cities. I'm glad the journalist made the effort to see the troubles for himself, next stop should be Rotherham and then Luton. It wont change his mind but I would love to hear what new phrase to describe this situation will be from the leftist think tank. Displacement activity. Lol
1	Referendum losers can go live among the world war losers and they can all lose together.  And don't worry, when the EU wants to expand into Russia and the middle east with an EU army, it'll purely be in your interests!
0	If Europeans would take the British press seriously we would be in a state of war by now
1	Holy Crap! PragerU got Nigel Farage! My God this guy is a savage, a true British hero!
0	Good riddance. EU don’t need you.
0	England got what they wanted and have gained their freedom from what they consider to be a "broken" union. We Scots will do the same, breaking free from the tyranny of Westminster and rejoin our family in the EU. We'll be back...soon.
1	Good riddance of the Brits. They were never truly European.
1	Germany will quickly discover that it was actually the British, not the French, who were their strongest allies in the EU ... at least on the free trade front. Other than Germany with its export-oriented economy, the remaining EU countries that support free trade are actually tiny, import-dependent countries. Other than France, the remaining "large" countries in the EU are depressed basket cases like Italy and Spain, while the rest of the EU is former communist countries hungry for development funds but otherwise hostile to the entire thing.
0	Still Leavers get another 11 months where they can pretend that leaving is the same as staying but with nice blue passports and shiny new 50p pieces.
0	I would put money on that brexit day poster being made by some remainers trying to rubbish bexiteers. Hopefully the police catchup with whoever did it and we find out.
0	The UK is a lost cause soon after leaving eu, to be a third world country run by snake oil salesmen.
1	Its time to taking back londonistan
1	Good for Britain. Brexit is just like 1776  for America
1	The UK will sign new independent trade deals with individual EU nations and work out a free trade deal with the US that is currently going through an economic boom. Think about it, it isn't a head scratcher. It's all fine for the UK.
0	Voting to stay in the EU, simply because I haven't seen enough  sufficient evidence that we'll better off by leaving.  It just seems  like a rash, risky and not very well thought through decision to cut  ourselves out already, plus all the vote leave fear-mongering is hardly  warming me to their cause. I'd rather for the time being that Europe  stuck together and tried to work through the current issues it faces. At  least the EU can protect certain laws. I also like how connected and  mobile our current generation are. I worry that if our leaving became a  catalyst for a more fragmented Europe it would set things back, e.g.  more unrest, war, nationalism.
0	We are doomed
1	A British flag has been flying from my house all week, ready for BREXIT, RULE BRITANNIA.
0	Dear Boris, I am unable to pay for the ex Royals security as my imposed TV licence has just gone up 3 quid and I can't afford both - plz sort at your earliest convenience, much appreciated old chap
1	Congratulation! EU it is failed!!!
0	It's a dark few years ahead
1	DO as we say not as we do attitude from the crumbling block ..
1	UK finally leaves the EU...wow that was almost as difficult as closing an AT&T account.
1	We are now out - so WE determine what WE want to accept...or not accept. & to all Returners (formally know as Remainers), you can stop taking the EU's side now - we are out...gone...& not going back!!!
1	Freedom for the People, we are now a Sovereign Nation again!!!
1	Love It...Go Boris...It Is Happening All Over The World.
0	Awh brexit is happening tonight ?? Goodbye spice girls
0	What happens? Nothing good. The UK is finished.
0	NOtHING will get better as a result of delivering Br exit. NOtHING!
0	We've already hit 2008 levels of economic recession, just by voting to leave. This is a disaster for Britain, plain and simple
0	Once the welfare state is dismantled then no more sponging foreigners will come in, that totally makes starving in a ditch unable to afford basic healthcare totally worth it right?
1	Such a happy but also sad day. Britain is one of the greatest nations on this earth. After the US of course. Lol
1	People voted to leave. What is it that they don't understand?
1	Imagine the remoaners tonight,,there will be a tsunami of tears,,BOOOOO HOOOO
1	Im just glad it's over
0	I went to bed a Remainer and woke up a Rejoiner. No surrender! #RejoinEU
1	Especially now that the UK no longer has to subsidise the other EU member nations, it can turn all that money to resolving any and all economic problems in its poorer regions.
0	I bet the Scots really wish they had their independence now.
0	Bumped into acquaintance at shop this morning.  Asked how she was.  Said fine looking forward to Friday.  I looked totally blank.  She then said “Coming out on Friday.  Are you going to the party at the pub?”  The lunatics are now totally in charge of the asylum.
0	Sneering contempt for people's valued freedoms and rights, thrown away to satisfy the self pitying victim fixation of poorly educated saps at the behest of disaster capitalists and the Etonian elite is the real problem facing post Brexit Britain.
1	Those unelected overlords in Brussels are not happy you fine Brits took your country back and will try to punish you as a example. Stay strong my cousins across the pond, we back you all the way !
1	We're leaving a political union not the blinking continent!! We are still European just not members of a bloated unelected self serving political union…
0	The big promises, and blah, blah, blah are now over. Britain needs more than big words. So from next week, Brits should expect action. If it doesn't happen, you'll know you've all been tricked. Tricked by big words and bigger promises.
0	Would someone kindly explain how the UK will ever enter again into such hugely successful co-operative ventures as AirBus, EuroTunnel, EuroFighter or the European Space Agency and CERN? Or maybe you think none of these matter and we're going to sail along with little industry relying on the parasites of the City or dubious Russian money to bridge the enormous balance of trade deficit we have.I'm just waiting for the good Burghers of Calais to stop policing the waterfront and let anyone cross la Manche: why should they bother?
0	What a shame. We as Brits should be embarrassed…
1	Top speech. If he means what he says then it will do for me. Clever venue as well.
1	Happy Brexit day !
1	Congrats to the Brits from USA! You are no longer under the control under of the un-elected elites in Brussel. Don't let the elites trick you to get back into the EU
1	When Brexit won, I smiled the whole day
1	Send all foreign invaders who are of no use to us home.
0	Why has it all gone so horribly wrong? Please tell us Boris.
1	Gee the BBC just can't hide their bias and disappointment that white unelected elites no longer control Britain.....The EU has been exposed for exactly what they are.....sucko!!!
0	Thanks god they left
1	If anyone in the EU had any sense, theyd disband this Undemocratic Heap of c - - P
0	I sincerely hope that the UK will STAY in the EU in the future. As a european citizen I really believe we in the united EU countries make a stronger argument for trade and macro economics with the world like the united states of america. Together we ARE stronger.
0	losing so much. gaining nothing.
1	At 11pm tonight, Britain will leave the European Union. After more than three years, we can finally say that we have delivered on the result of the 2016 referendum and have kept faith with the British people.
0	the worst decision made by UK in a long, long time
0	britain votes to regress back to the unilateral dark ages. enjoy dealing with that con artist liar fraud trump who will sell u a one sided deal split into phases until you're reacquired into being a vassal state completely under americas oligarch control & dominating surveilance. hahahahahahahaha go have a pint faragetards. that grinning goofball moron farage has just tricked u all into abandoning your defense ramparts which is the european union bloc. it's the counterbalance to the other powers china united states particularly lmfao
0	We've seen with Brexit and other things that there's a dark impulse to be petulant and frustrated with complicated solutions
1	Happy days are here again!
0	Leaving the EU is like dropping out of school, its lazy&may seem best but staying&working to overcome any problems is far better
0	Just wait. When reality hits and this pipe dream about reigniting the British Empire and restoring it to its former glory evaporates
1	sooner or later the EU bean counters are going to wonder from where they are going to find the billions that Blighty no longer pays into their Empire..............Germany and France will have to fill the gap as some of the other economies in their glorious Empire are tanking or on the brink
0	Technology, globalisation, austerity and many other factors have changed the landscape of the world we live in. Leaving the EU will not remedy these changes no matter what.
1	well this might be one more memorable day for world history.
0	Conservatives will destroy everything, literally, in the world given the chance.
1	a shed load of new laws from the eu where waiting  till after the vote, thank nigel (god) we got out.
0	Brexiters want their grandchildren to be poor just so they can feel good about themselves having “achieved” something in life.
0	Celebrate good times
0	Why change, when there is not so much wrong
0	Brexit. Estimated cost to Mental Health: Infinite.
1	Overwhelming majority in this country back you Boris, do a deal with the Brexit Party and get this done!
1	And by September last year, more of England's councils joined in, once more celebrating Brexit by pouring raw sewage
0	Why did the UK not defeat crime and transform the NHS all along? Nothing was stopping them
0	Boris Johnsson is a wanker
1	I think life will go on pretty much as before but with extra expense and hassle!
0	21 Tory MPs lost the whip for trying to block a no-deal Brexit
0	The Daily Express takes the opportunity to claim success for their campaign to leave the EU, telling readers: “Yes, we did it.” Indeed! for once they are telling the TRUTH!! without the lies and the odious anti immigrant anti EU propaganda which they have systematically used for decades we would not be where we are today, at the edge of a precipice! That also goes for the Sun and the Daily Mail. They can all congratulate themselves and each other for a job well done!! Now , readers of the most corrupt press in the West, ENJOY!!
1	As someone who lived a number of years in Europe, including in the U.K., I congratulate Nigel Farage and the Brits on regaining their sovereignty and FREEDOM from the clutches of Brussels.  Best wishes to the United Kingdom from TEXAS!
0	Wellcome to being a vassal state, for at least a year, you know, the condition that Rees-Mogg and Johnson said we would never be.
1	Good riddance see EU later
1	Honestly, this already took so long and now it’s gonna take at least another year for a trade deal? What a major waste of time.
1	no need for a free trade agreement to involve accepting EU rules on competition, subsidies, social protection
1	Boris Johnson won a massive landslide victory in a general election. #GoBrexit
1	This is what the EU were afraid of, can you imagine what the produces of 27 countries are going to say to those unelected beaurocrats in Brussels, yep, just as we thought," we still need to trade with the UK our livelihoods depend on it " when will they ever learn ?
0	My dad’s from North Yorkshire and I’m a UK citizen (lived there for 8 years) so I’ve been following it closely.  It has been an overwhelming failure so far. It will, and has been, objectively detrimental to the British economy and state itself (with parties like the SNP gaining influence as a result).   Farage is also a complete and total coward for resigning from UKIP the moment he got his wish, instead of taking the reins and steering the ship. That being said, however, him not being PM is probably a good thing.  Theresa May was ineffective, but BoJo’s a complete mess. Won’t be surprised if Corbyn is the inevitable outcome.  I wish the UK the best of luck with it (because it affects me too). I don’t want to see a No-Deal Brexit, but the options really do seem to be running out.
1	The only British jobs guaranteed to be lost if the country votes #Brexit are the 73 UK MEP's
1	Personally, I made a ton of money off of the event of Brexit and I'll likely make more money once some taxes are gotten rid of that couldn't happen while in the EU.
0	I look at this and think, im so glad to live in the netherlands and be part of an actual working economic union called THE EU, have a nice life try not to die UK peeps
1	All the remainers .can go and all the leavers can stay
1	Finally getting Brexit moving.
0	I've never seen so many people celebrating the loss of privileges.
1	Stay strong, You'll be free of the tyrannical EU soon enough.
1	"I think the economy is going to be a lot better of if we stay in Europe." You are going to stay in Europe no matter what haha. You are deciding whether remain in the European Union or not.
1	I'm voting Leave as I don't think 6 unelected people in Brussels should be able to dictate the laws of our country.
0	Believe it when it see it, I just worried about what you are going to give away to get Brexit.
0	All the government's plans seem to assume we can simply go out and take other countries market share. It really isn't that easy or we would have done it already.
0	The people driving the train of Brexit are deluded immature fantasists.  Especially our priapic PM. Even if Brexit could have had a happy  conclusion in an alternative universe, in ours it’s the monstrous spawn  of Brexit Boris, Farage, Raab, Patel, Fox, Francois, IDS, Leadsom,  Truss, Gove, Redwood, Cummings, Widdecoombe, Rees-Mogg and so on. I hope  that list is illustrative enough.
0	I fear any financial gains are swallowed up in the cost of the transitions , f knows how much Brexit has cost up to now . It may take decades if ever to be any ‘better off’
1	Following three years of turmoil, the UK is likely to have the most stable political environment in Europe for the next
1	8 out of the top 10 countries that the UK exports to are EU countries, but never mind, the UK is going to find some poorer countries to export to instead and somehow get paid the same prices...........good luck with that guys
0	Look at what the divisiveness of Brexit has done to the U.K.
1	My first votes didn't go wasted.I voted to leave.proud and happy.
0	Still Zero plan or details on how they - and Northern Ireland - will trade with the EU, police immigration, etc. In effect, they've now actually jumped out of a plane without a parachute, with Boris saying he's confident that there'll be a solution to the issue before an undesirable cranial matter-ground interface with the rapidly approaching terra firma. All while that shifty fucker Farage dances around on the sidelines. Great.
0	For anyone arriving from Europe into the U.K. from 1st Feb, remember you’ll need to adjust your watch for the time difference. We’re now about 30 years behind
0	I  already Belfast blowing up after this...
0	Brexshit, the gift that just keeps on taking.
0	Hey, people. I am British and do NOT want to leave the EU. I am ashamed at some of the eurosceptic outpourings from politicians. I am proud to be European and thin it as astonishing achievement that we have al held together in the last 70 years. We’re not all bad !!!
1	When a second country leaves, the dominos will fall like leaves from a tree at 1st freeze. No country will wish to miss out on free trade, not controlled by some unelected officials in Brussels.
0	Britain will be a nation with no future if we leave without a trading agreement with the EU. The negatives are that we will have to pay tariffs on any goods we export to Europe, making our goods more expensive in Europe
1	Fantastic news, this is just the start more countries will leave over time
1	They will struggle in the beginning as they get their sea legs, but just like when US declared its independence from Britain, so to Britain will succeed in their national freedom.
0	Bunch of old people celebrating for something that will affect the new generation and not them…
0	you need immigrants because you didnt make babies but want your pension. someone has to do the work, because you dont want to go back working on the farms. now after leaving the eu, make a legislation that lets employed immigrants stay and unemployed have to go home. problem solved
0	Yesterday was my first vote: I voted to remain in the EU. I felt strongly that the EU was something which we needed to be. For me it wasn’t about politics. It was not about whether we’re Labour or Conservative, or right or left, it was about what we stand for. As a nation, could we really stand for abandoning an organisation which, although admittedly flawed, brings together so many nations in a common purpose? I hoped not. For me a vote for Europe was a vote for humanity and a vote for possibility and therefore this morning my first reaction was one of devastation.  After far too many tears and a lot of anger directed towards the older generations and the politicians who failed to make this referendum moral and true, I want to make sure that my first vote, my first taste of democracy, leads to something positive. My first vote is going to lead to even stronger political engagement. It’s so important that despite this result we pull together to show the world that we are not hostile or prejudiced towards them.  We have to be open to the future, and work to create a positive future. We are the future and although today our country has chosen to disregard our opinions, from now on we have to work even harder to make our voices heard. Today is the start of a new future, of a different future. Let’s not decide that everything is doomed. Instead, let’s work for a positive and accepting future of possibility, rather than the hostility that has been shown today.  I know that the result of this referendum could have a huge impact on my future. I’m hoping to study German at university, but I also recognise that we can’t be too negative about today. Nothing can come from deciding that everything is damned, we’ve got to rise from the ashes and show the world our capability for love and good.
1	Eternally grateful to Boris for keeping those Remainers out and giving the nation a sense of pride and optimism that has been lacking for sometime now
0	Embarrassment of a country. So glad i left
0	What I still to this day don't understand is how Europe is and became the enemy. It just does not make sense.
0	Why are so many people in the UK politically ignorant? Is this a failure of our education system? And, if it is, why is this the case?
0	Just call it off! You can still not exit.
1	This time tomorrow our Great country will be on a new future that we control, govern and direct.  There's been generations of people whilst under EU rule, who have not known or experienced how great the United Kingdom was and what we have to offer the World and what a fantastic position we are viewed from by other countries around the World, countries that are lining up to be part of our future.   Yes we will have re-moaners saying next week why hasn't the Government changed anything and lets go back, but that's just part of this instant change culture that expect everything to be done at a click of a button.  Things take time, great changes takes time.  Happy Brexit Day  :-)
1	i live in the u.k and its about time we had our say and our independance back we are once again united kingdom …
0	Brexiters often try to oversimplify the economics of trade in order  to maintain the fiction that buccaneering Britain can forge its own way  in the world independent of the great trading blocks of China, the US  and the EU. And of course they cite prosperous independent countries  that are not in the thrall of any of them. Switzerland, Japan and South  Korea are often mentioned. The devil is, as always, in the detail and one big detail is the fact  that British industry has for over 40 years been busy integrating with  Europe. Readjusting to life outside will be painful. Businesses will go  bust and others will have to make painful changes. Of course knowing  what changes are required would help but we are still in the dark on  that one. When we look at how other smaller economies go it alone brexiters  need to consider how they do it. Some in Asia have working practices and  employment rights that no European would ever accept. There would be  riots in the streets - even in supine Britain. We are not going to  become South Korea or Malaysia. Other countries are small and specialise  - we could do that but again the transition would be painful. In order to keep our mixed economy afloat and particularly the  services sector Britain needs trade deals with many countries. Doing  deals with countries smaller than we are should be relatively  straightforward but we cannot survive without the big three. With them  we are very weak. We no longer have the heft of the EU behind us and we  will be bullied by all three of them.
0	Tired of listening to the regurgitated lies and propaganda about Europe. Course we’ll prosper in isolation we have such a thriving manufacturing sector…..oh no we don’t do we Maggie destroyed that!
1	please leave EU asap
0	I don't often agree with a Tory. But he's right on this matter. The UK cannot make a monumental mistake and leave the EU.
1	Bye Bye EU BYE BYE.   The FT don't like the little people winning!   Ha ha ha.
1	Another article that fails to understand Brexit or what’s going on in the UK.  It’s subjective that it’s pointless. We want to leave the EU and FoM etc. Don’t you get it? We want it for good reasons.
0	What strikes me most is that a high majority of younger people voted to remain. In other words, Britain's future is compromised by an old and retro-minded population touched by extreme nationalism and xenophobia. You have my sympathy.
1	The UK and Germany have been propping up the EU for decades and the lazy, feckless and workshy countries have gone bankrupt and contributed noting except being a drain. on our economy.
0	For those Brexitors, please don't count your chickens just yet. Only time will show you the real consequences of your decisions.
1	he world is so proud of our Brits
1	Great job UK. Globalism is a failed idea. The world is safe when all nations are strong prosperous and self dependent
0	The EU states sell a great deal to the UK - trade is a two way traffic.
1	Thanks for challenging the establishment on behalf of the normal people Mike. Thanks for championing democracy the cornerstone of this great country.
0	Britain is splitting from the EU because people in some parts of the UK don’t want to answer to Europe and are ill-informed about the actual impact immigrants make on social services (little...it’s Tory cuts to just about any social service the government used to provide that is causing pressure). This withdrawal would also mean losing the worker’s rights they have enjoyed as a result of membership. The UK has a limited manufacturing base to support itself, and what it possesses in terms of large scale manufacturing has, with a few exceptions, begun making plans for pulling out of the country because of the implications of Brexit. There is some agricultural development but the UK is generally shifting to a largely service-based economy, services people won’t be able to pay for when their wages drop with the loss of rights, nor have time for when their working hours per week are extended. Food quality will drop as the UK imports from the US, where they have had FOUR major recalls of basic fresh food in the last three weeks, alone. But hey, blue passports! I think I understand it pretty well, no?
0	So according the #Brexit there will be no more fishing quotas and the seas will suddenly fill with fish
0	European football will never be the same again
1	"UK TO BE THE FIRST COUNTRY TO LEAVE EU",  I'm just so very proud reading that.
0	anyone else wondering why our journalists and mainstream media didn't provide this and further in depth debate and analysis before the vote in 2016? looking back, there was such a lack of real factual debate hence the 300 mil nhs slogan. People voted to leave, but did they do so with a real knowledge of the impact on trade, customs checks, good Friday agreement and other issues ?
0	"I don’t think we should have voted. I can barely rate a film on Netflix, don’t leave big decisions in my hands. Brexit is a terrible name for it, sounds like cereal you eat when you are constipated."
0	#BrexitDay I have a French dad, a British Mum  and today feels strange, sad and wrong. #NotMyBrexit
1	Unfortunately, the EU Commission is not concerned with actual people or countries.  They are there for 'The Project'. They've brought Europe the glories of the CAP and the Euro; who knows what they'll do next. But we can be sure it own't be logical or sensible.
1	OUTSTANDING! Another direct hit to the global socialists.
0	"We are an independent country once again" Me: ahahaha no
1	MEGA - MAKE ENGLAND GREAT AGAIN! BREXIT!
0	I'm voting remain. the EU is a known system, leaving is a risk we don't  need to take. Plus I like being part of a larger system, unlike some of  my countrymen I don't view the UK as some islands far away from europe.   Plus in my more naive moments I like to imagine that this sort of  large union could lead to the utopian future I read in sci-fi novels as a  kid.
0	expectations are unrealistic and nobody obliged UK to adhere to EU , they seem to forget
1	Well done Britain we will prosper. Good to see the commonwealth coming  back together too. God save our queen
1	It has features very few people like (e.g. the unelected Commission and the parliament with little power, the fact that it is a mighty block with no foreign policy of its own).
0	God bless our Europa
1	Democracy has won. This is the beginning of the end of the 2nd iteration of the Holy Roman Empire. May other Euro countries also desire from and democracy.
1	I'm generally fine with it. The EU is a very different beast than it was when the UK started, and maintaining national sovereignty is a worthwhile goal.
0	Guardian front page should be “Small island, small minds”.
0	Never, in our recent history have so few managed to brain wash so many with so little.
0	I'm one of the 2 million UK citizens who live and work outside the country thanks to EU membership. Free movement and trade is so important for the future of country. So many people in the UK who have not lived or worked in any other EU country have no idea what the benefits are. It goes 2 ways. There are so many opportunities outside the UK - it would be a shame if our wonderful country left the EU.
0	The hard line Brexiteers are a deluded dangerous gang of fanatics.
1	Seems like a disaster to me.
1	Don't forget to take a BLACK pen with you tomorrow so your vote can't be tampered with! Vote LEAVE and let's make June 24th our independence day!
1	So happy for Great Britain. They have their life back!
0	It would be a spectacularly self-defeating move. And nobody has the time to go through the whole process of having them come crawling back yet again just because their domestic politics is basically a kindergarden.
0	You think you are so big you don’t need anybody.... it will be so beautiful to see you fall....
1	NO Deal please, out of the EU and its organisations that's what Cameron and the rest of them said, even if they now are trying to back track on it now the interviews and literature is out there showing their two faced views. I Voted for Leave, and in a democracy when you win the vote you expect that policy it to be implemented.
1	The Independent continues to try and provide an echo chamber for dissolute remainers
0	A Brexit with a poor outcome will damage our country and lead to years of further division.
1	I understood the message from Boris! We Europeans are undesirable as long as we don't give UK power and money!
0	I found this quite interesting from Brexit supporter Geoff Norcott!
1	All yours Boris, well done. Don’t let down the fishermen please. Let’s put the Great back into Britain
1	EU: New refugee quotas in EU! Nations will have to pay £200.000 per refugee they refuse. That is blackmail! #LeaveEU
0	So sad :(. I was really hoping something similar to the eu would spread across the world.
0	Yeah, it's starting to really hit some of them now. I'm British and legally live in the EU27 - there are quite a few Brexiters who also live in the EU27 who are now shitting themselves because they will now be treated as (gasp) illegal immigrants unless they start paying taxes and abiding by the law. There's another Brexiter faction who are still spouting crap like, 'They need us here' and 'Nothing will change for us' because English exceptionalism is their 'reality'.
0	It’s interesting to hear Leavers proclaiming that we are now "freed from the EU shackles" yet fail to understand that the UK is now in "vassalage" to the EU for the rest of the year and possibly longer!
0	What's the EU 'done for us'? · structural funding to areas hit by industrial decline; · clean beaches and rivers; lead free petrol;
1	It says something about the dire moribund intellectual void that is pro Euro leftist dogma, that when a nation democratically leans toward cessation from a failing inept corrupt undemocratic illusion of prosperity, such as the EU.
1	Congratulations, you have become the most hated country in Europe. Good luck
1	mindful of everybody’s feelings
0	Brexit is going to run into tricky waters, with the Titanic kipper captain at the helm.
0	Yes but think of all the advantages of Brexit!!.. ahem ...er what are they actually?
1	The bbc missed the part where they have been calling white working class brits racist and anything about our culture as toxic
1	We have won a peaceful revolution.  We have defeated the europhile globalist, protectionist authoritarians both in the UK and in the global elite and ensured the future of our country for generations to come  is one of sovereign democracy.  Thankyou fellow Brexiteers , Thankyou Farage, Thankyou Boris.  It’s down to you, all heroes.
1	Silly Eurocrats believed that more rules and regulations 'make life better', but the only thing that comes from more laws is more 'law breakers'.     So glad Britain has finally left that stupid EU!   I am looking forward to normal lightbulbs again, no VAT on electricity and gas that will result in lower energy bills, and the ability of people in the UK to decide on what rules if any, we want.   Time to build a massive bonfire outside 10 Downing Street and throw all the volumes of books that contain all the silly EU rules and burn them!
0	You cant say that the UK pays money to the EU without mentioning this, if you remove the money spend, you also have to add the money earned
1	Unlike many other countries in the EU the UK is a rules based society that was always going to find the false straightjacket of the EU impossible to live with - we were never going to settle into the EU - This new adventure is as exciting as it is scary, but is so much better than staying in.
1	Funny how the EU are now starting to ask us for things... how the tables have turned
0	Good bye UK. May you rest in peace.
0	Britain's GDP will fall like a rock as they rid themselves of the brightest 10% of their population in slamming the door on immigrants. The USA will be joining them in the has-been category quite soon. One sure result: a free and independent Scotland.
0	All I can say is that I'm glad I don't live in England right now. I have the luxury of watching my homeland go to shit from the other side of the planet where the wife and I have stable, pretty well-paid jobs. I see a lot of instability in all kinds of sectors in England in the next few years.
1	I'm an Englishman living in France. I know what goes on here--- for God's sake, get out.
0	The BBC has become as dumbed down as a brexiter.
0	I'm hugely upset about Brexit. I think the EU is a beacon of light in a dangerous world, and the UK government have decided to leave under dubious circumstances
0	A very sad day presided over by an utter dolt. But, like Trump, half the population think he's great. The ignorant half.
0	Time will tell what the advantages of Brexit (if any) are. All of the rhetoric by Farage and his Brexit Party misfits, will soon be shown to be a pack of lies. Never mind, the English proletariat don't care, now they have their freedumb.
1	Absolutely bang on we voted out full stop with all the challenges that come with it . Not a little bit out or halfway out we vote OUT .
1	Britain wants to keep its national sovereignty and make its decisions effecting their people all on its own without some massive bureaucratic body based in Belgium interfering or other countries interfering that may not share British values.
1	boot em out, we dont need this trash in EU
1	Isn’t it amazing, what an historic moment, yet again Britain has done something no other country dared to.
0	Listen. The immigrant children that live in this country would have their dreams and future fulfilments crushed if the country leaves the EU. I'm a 16 year old boy that feels the same way. I don't want to leave this country. This is my only hope of becoming a doctor in the future. In Lithuania I stand no chance, as the economy is poorly and funding into education is quite limiting too.   I really want to stay in this country. I would lose so many friends if we left, as well as leaving my education behind.   Do yourself a favour and stop being such racists and ignoring the range of advantages of staying in the EU. I promise you there will be more of them than if you would vote leave.  Thank you.
0	Lose-lose for Europe and UK both
0	As someone from Ireland, I'm terrified for my relatives up in the North. What happened to the Good Friday agreement that was promised? The bloodshed is going to come back and it's all your fault
0	"Those who have money are voting in" I will say just on this point, my family have been in shit money-wise for years, we're all voting in because we don't want to end up skint in another recession, and all the more middle class people we know have had varying opinions. I say vote in, then in 5 or 10 years when we can come up with a solid plan, vote again to leave. I can't imagine leaving based on flimsy stats and uncertainties.
1	It isn't goodbye, it is hello, from an independent UK.
0	I'm so embarrassed, these fuck wits actually get to vote. Only reason for majority
0	Britain - ruining european unions since 1815
1	Yes!!!! We can finally push though all those rules that nobody can name now!
1	I’m staying well away from the Brexit celebrations tonight. The stench of Lynx Africa and John Player Specials will be fucking toxic #BrexitCelebration
0	More fantasy trade agreements from brexit clan... Look forward to losing thousands of jobs while this guy gets his deal smacked down.
1	We will decide ourselves no longer will we have to tow the line!
1	I support Boris 100%
1	Makes you wonder how the 92.2% of people worldwide not in the EU survive
1	Towns and small cities across the UK are deprived of industry, jobs, and evolution onto the modern stage.
0	And nothing about it on the #ITVNews at 6.30pm either. Is it just me who thinks this is important.
0	We should have to prepare for the referendum for not to leave EU
0	UK shooting themselves in the foot like the US then claims victory :D lol rich
1	the rational for Europe used to be PEACE but it is no longer, now the rational for Europe is POWER
0	The British voted to leave the EU based upon racism without thinking the issue through just as Americans out of racism, anger, fear, selfishness elected the unfit, illegitimate Trump as president.
0	I think everybody should have known what they were voting for, so after making your bed, it is time to sleep in it.
1	This is the greatest moment in the history of our great nation
0	Yesterday Europe regarded us as a nation with influence - today they see us as a tribe with a flag.
1	Other countries manage to function without membership of EU. And there’s a whole world to trade with out there.
1	I don’t want to be dragged down by the Romanian or Greek economy
1	Glad the people who live there got a say in what happens to their country.  I would have voted to leave if I lived there, so I agree with their vote.  But I'm not a citizen there so my opinion does not matter.
0	I know I talk smack about #brexit but it's actually the most ridiculous thing to happen. It was a populist and immature move my Cameron and now Britain WILL absolutely suffer. I also know that all my friends / family and normal minded people voted #remain
1	Epic. Came, saw, won. We’re off! #Brexit
1	Yesss I want the lefties to be kicking and screaming
0	The problem with Brexit is how it was won. Instead of it being properly thought through right at the start it was effectively hashed together with clearly little thought with what to do if the public actually voted to leave. It should have been clearly defined that IF people voted to leave then there would have been another referendum on how people wanted to leave, which would have also included an option to remain, because the reality the UK has found itself in is somewhat different to what people were sold at the time.
1	Good, I hope they do leave the EU.
1	SIR NIGEL FARAGE: National HERO, great patriot of British history - living LEGEND !!! :-)
1	Decision 100% right.but long lead. after wells u.k fiancee
0	The EU guarantees a floor standard. Take the floor away and what stops a race to the bottom?
0	What you have done!! Uk cant survive without Eu in the future you will beg to join Eu again!
0	Barnier rattled the EU's sabre. Johnson twanged the UK's butter knife!
0	Brexit: Boris Johnson accused of failing to protect small businesses as one third say they are ready to leave UK.  Have we forgotten Johnson said when asked "F. Business" And he is not only a PM but a Tory!
1	The tower of Babel will fall.
1	If the UK wants to remove itself from the EU, then that's just one population group that isn't having its policy dictated by some large overlord government.
0	Bremainers seem to believe that not a single country on the planet can survive outside of the EU. Obiously not true.
1	What an unbiased read the guardian is.
1	So proud of the British. Breaking away from the Neo-marxist globalist regime.
1	We have a government that will make a success of Brexit. It's also the first one in many decades that I haven't completely despised.
1	We can only hope now that Britain will be great.
0	YOU CAN ACCEPT THE EU RULES IF YOU HAVE HIGHER STANDARDS THAN THE EU REQUIRES! HOW DUMB IS JOHNSON?
0	Brexit = the most pointless exercise, ever.
0	like a spoilt teenager eager to move out of mum n dads. Unawares of the true cost of living, too naïve to understand, but mainly too arrogant to care about the repercussions of their actions.
0	UK collapse
1	I’ve met loads of remoaner racists. Also met leavers who are racist but my experience has been more remain than leave.
0	Its damaging and really needs to be stopped going to far now
1	The UK can move ahead with trade deals world wide, and the EU can come back to the UK when they are ready.
0	No, because I believe in the free movement of goods and services.
1	The EU sounds like an ex girlfriend that keeps screaming “YOU NEED ME!” Might be a struggle at first, but it means freedom forever from a toxic, clingy relationship!
1	Congratulations to our British brothers and sisters! Huzzah! The USA always has your back!
1	Let's hope it's the beginning of the end of the Imperialist EU. 🇬🇧
0	I hope you say 'great day' in the following months!!!!
1	As a eurosceptic I'm delighted at how piss poor the 'Remain' campaign are. All they have is scaremongering, near enough all of it 'the sky will fall in' by laying out the worst case scenario.
0	Condolences to the citizens of the late Great Britain.
1	Most of the mainstream media have been the enemy of the people of the UK for a long time.  I'm sure now that the UK is independent, the mainstream media will continue to hate the people of the UK.  I think the first ones to go should be the BBC and The Guardian of Communism.
0	16 days before we are loosing our rights to be European in the UK. I won't get my mouth shut. Johnson destroyed our future.  This selfish is taking our rights away from us. I don't accept that.
0	Just call it off! You can still not exit. The EU says it’s ok. Tell your elected representatives to stop the whole thing. Then you could all say you were having a laugh.
0	So @Keir_Starmerwhat would you like the argument to move on to? @jessphillipshas been very clear that our country is better off in the EU & will hold Johnson to account.  As a #Remainer I'm not bowing to Johnsons wish that we now just unite & accept Brexit...
1	grats to all my brothers and sisters in the UK
1	Another great British victory over Europe
0	Wish we could do a no confidence vote and demand another election.
0	I long back to how bad I thought Brexit would turn out one year ago. One year on and somehow there seems to be even less of a plan and those in charge seem to have even less of a clue what they are doing.
1	CONGRATULATIONS, BRITAIN!! MUCH LOVE AND ENVY FROM CANADA!!
0	Leavers are going to be pointing the finger of blame at the EU, Remainers, von der Leyen, a dead scabby cat & a fly-tipped fridge for the next 10yrs, as all of their #Brexit fantasies come to nought. Gaslighting is all they have. When they do this it’s probably wise to disengage.
1	Good job! the European union is the enemy of everyone's democracy
1	From the common market to the commonwealth
1	Having a stricter immigration policy will only disadvantage those who choose to take advantage of Britain in favour of those who will be of the greatest benefit.
1	Britain is a country that has led the world and it has certainly saved Europe in the past
0	A colleague who is a vehement Brexiter is now screaming blue murder about the bl**dy froggies because he will have to pay £12 everytime he and his wife want to visit their holday home in the Dordogne. Har bl**dy har, say I.
0	It has it's problems and has had for many years, but that is no reason to abandon the EU. The EU is as much about the future as the present, it is about what is best for this Country and our children and the EU holds the best prospects for both.
0	It only makes sense that any company wanting to sell into the EU would be required to meet EU rules...and that if that company is outside of the EU they'll need to show that they're meeting those rules for their product. This was always going to be expensive as they'll also need to meet UK rules for their product. So twice the overhead (at least as long as they rules aren't mutually contradictory in which case they may need to produce two different versions of the product).
1	Love Brexit, just love it :) And this is only beginning ;)
0	We are gone from the EU. now we are going to get no help with the coroner virus thx brexit we are all dead
0	The saddest time of my life. I am 70, I've lived a lifetime with peace in western Europe thanks to European integration. Look back over preceding decades, centuries to see how miraculous that is. The movement was based on the idea that peace happens when the parties have a vested economic interest in it, it has succeeded 100%. We should be at the heart of it, not skulking off-stage.
1	I voted leave.  It has nothing at all to do with immigration. I love Europe, but the EU has done it's job. now it has become an undemocratic, bloated beurocracy and it no longer acts in British national interests.  I have lived in the far east for a large part of my life and spent a large chunk of my time in the USA and south America. We do not need to be chained to an Eurocentric attitude to trade and relations. We are not turning our back on the EU, we are opening the doors to the rest of the world and we are doing it on OUR terms, not the EU's.
0	the EU is better off without the UK.
0	the day the country died
1	How Europe lost britain more like
0	A really well thought out argument, and one I agree with to an extent. However, I voted remain as I feel change to the structure and function of the EU would be easier from inside the club.
0	I'm not just a Remainer. I'm a European through and through, and the rats have taken over the ship.
1	New Dawn.....new beginnings, the future is bright....Rule Britannia!!!
0	Britain will just keep brexiting infinitum, until its just farage and the Queen throwing shit at each other with everyone else having been kicked into the sea for not being British enough.
1	The UK has finally gotten their sovereignty back, the EU started out as a good deal, turned into a monster that ate away at the UK's freedoms.
1	I hope they leave
1	Congratulations to the people of the U.K. #BrexitReality . You can now move forward as powerful independent nation and negotiate better trade deals then the unelected old men in Brussels.Sadly in Ireland we don’t have a politician with the balls to offer the people a referendum.
1	Enough of this blackmailing, goal post moving rubbish Boris...do what we should have done 4 years ago...Walk Away, No Deal is still better than a Bad Deal...And take another look at the 39 billion if they are playing that game.
1	Yay! You’re free! Everyone should have a huge celebration! No more being told how to run your beautiful country! No more being told how many immigrants and from what countries you have to let in! No more of your companies being fined millions of pounds because the EU says to! No more having to accept cookies from every website because the EU requires you do that! Freedom! Your wonderful citizens deserve this! Your children will have bright futures ahead of them! I’m so proud of the British people! Good job!
0	Yes, we're all really, really happy about it. Just an incredible deal.
1	Remainer's are weird, they're like the community that uses crystals to cleans their negative energy......but crystals dont work now do they.
0	I always thought that adults know what they are doing.   Now as im growing older i notice everyone is actualy just clueless
0	The Brexiteers will soon see that have been deceived. When the cars factor in the North of England starts to close after is too late.
0	It’s ridiculous. It will completely destroy the country. No deal is worse tbf.
0	Not a good start, Boris
1	Notice the way the crowd was turned down in the mix on the opening sequence and in the national anthem art . They still can’t let go .
0	the uk leaves today the eu, but not europe mark my words i'll miss ya🇬🇧 🇷🇴
0	I understand what y'all are saying, but at the same time it's so handy to have the EU.. so easy to travel between the countries in it and i know so many people who managed to get european fonds for their business and ideas.. that's kinda hard to give up when you're already used to the bad parts and enjoing the good ones (that's why, i think, so many of us, europeans, see the EU as a great thing)
1	The EU has taken, taken and taken again over the years. The can't grasp that things have changed and slow on the uptake.
0	Can't wait for all the old people who voted for this to watch their pensions and social programs get slowly eviscerated, and blame the youth for their political ineptitude.
0	A new deal every day from the Johnson circus. They have absolutely no idea what they are up to. Today the EU produces a 33 page document on the next steps and way forward, Johnson gives a bizarre tub thumping speech. Utterly shambolic and predictable from Mr No detail.
1	We have finally taken our country back from the EU after 47 years. I love Britain, Europe and the European people, but strongly oppose the neoliberal and toxic EU: it is a dictatorship. Now let’s put the ‘Great’ back into Britain!
0	I think the best approach is to get over it and wait to see what happens. "I told you so" is about the only thing anyone who wanted to remain in the EU has left.
0	There are over 3 million peoples who work, pay taxes and live in UK and you just "forgot" to ask them if they want brexit. They are EU citizens. Do you still think you won the referendum?
1	The impact of no deal = freedom
0	4 years later the UK rejoins the EU.
0	As a strong believer that Brexit is a very damaging mistake that becomes more obvious every day, I see sound democratic reasons for asking the electorate to confirm what it wants to do.
0	Stay in but needs change
1	The EU will be much better off when the Brits leave.
1	GOOD! Shit should have happened 3 years ago. You got the support from us Trump supporters, but not from Americas left.
0	This sort of unreasonable thinking and angry behaviour makes me worried about the future. Trying to blame all problems on migrants when they have contributed so much to the U.K makes me feel sick.
0	Smart thing to do would be to step back and stick with the status quo to figure out what would work.
0	The Brits want everything for Free without hard work
0	UK is not leaving the EU ( still need to put to the budget for this year. Still need to follow EU regulations till end of the year ). What UK do they just leave from EU parliament and they do not have representative there. That’s it !
1	When the EU was called the common market with a membership of 6 nations back in the 1950s it was a pragmatic and even noble 'union' based on trade.   This was post war, European countries were skint, populations depleted, Germany was rubble, France was in dire straits. A loose trade alliance was a good thing.   Tragically by the early 60s it became a German/Franco carve-up which morphed into the democracy despising, nation destroying EU mutant we have now. Their goal: a superstate run by France/Germany via unelected, unaccountables with a pretend, sham Parliament to give the false impression of democracy to con the people of Europe.   10,000 EU officials earn more than the UK Prime minister. They have their own shopping maul. Chauffeur driven, 1st class flights and hotels, huge expenses all paid for by the people of Europe. Their goal is to rule Europe from Brussels.   For 60+ years this agenda has been hidden, secret, now it's out in the open and cannot be allowed. It is Nato that has kept peace not the EU. Yet another EU lie/myth.   History has shown what happens when a small group of 'elites' end up ruling over the many. It never ends well. People tend to suffer the consequences for decades until they cannot take anymore.   Had Remain won - each month, each year ordinary peoples right would be erased, bogged down by endless oppressive rules and regulations. Democracy all but dead. A dark path.   Thankfully the UK is about to leave. Eventually the EU will either sink into the abyss, split or change entirely.  For 5 minutes back in the 1950s the EU had it right - a trade alliance of democratic nations. For the other 60+ years it has got it wrong.   The UK has got it right.
0	What!? Are we leaving the EU!? Why?!..
1	Woohoo!!! The NHS is super excited to receive an extra £350 mil a week!!!
1	Climate change? The climate always changes, directed by the Sun. Boris... That is a EU hoax. Leave that as well... Talk to China and India about their pollution.
0	The UK's future is to hang from the USA's coat tails and pick up the scraps the big boys have dropped.
0	For the people of Britain it's simple. If everything wrong in this country is the fault of the EU, then leaving will prove that. On the other hand, if we start to slide into the abyss, then it will be obvious that it is our own politicians who are to blame. So the people will get to know who's exactly to blame in due course.
1	Brilliant speech, we need more like him on the side of Brexit and the majority who voted for it. Otherwise democracy will die and Corbyn will rule
1	We should leave the EU. I just hope that when we do, this government does get stricter on immigration and has an Aussie style points system. But knowing the tories they won't because their big business chums, LOVE immigration. If we leave the EU, France and Finland should follow suit.
0	Can't believe people were that deluded to vote leave... The poor sods! Glad we are staying
1	be able to have our own maritime borders not to be shared for fishing
1	I wouldn't worry about barnier and tusk. They will be remembered as the men who presided upon the fall of the great eu experiment as more and more EU nations fall out with the Brussels dictatorship.
0	I think it would be interesting to give people a sheet of paper with policies on it and ask people whether they think it's UK government policy or EU policy. See if people can tell what the EU actually does or if they still believe the lies told by Politicians and rag newspapers
1	Definitely was an out from me, and I'm young before people blame it all on the older generation ;)
1	Happy Brexit Day UK!!  Back to your status as an independent, sovereign nation.
1	Brexit ultimately is for the best.
0	ECONOMIC SUICIDE
1	Every member of the HoC who voted against Brexit or or Britain should be removed for treachery.That would get rid of about 75%.
0	If the UK votes to leave the EU then Scotland, Wales and NI should all leave the UK and let England go its own mad way.
0	I feel like many people do not see the great impact and were misled by the personal short-term goals of some politicians.
0	This is embarrassingly crap! This will be shown all over the world as us leaving Europe, OMG
0	Brexiters, not having fought in the war: “We didn’t fight in the war to stay in the EU” People who actually fought in the war: “We didn’t fight in the war for a terrible idea like Brexit”
0	really hope its not gonna happen
0	European Union makes it seem like it's for Europe when in reality it's basically making Europe worse nowadays
1	Mainly because I feel that in order to ensure that we remain a relatively free society (UK free lol I know) we cannot continue to support a continent-wide government that will only continue to absorb more and more power from the member states.
0	I'm going to feel sorry for the English people after brexit economic collapse, who are going to work like slaves just to pay bills and the government steals them worse than they are already doing
0	And the truly staggering thing is that probably half the people who voted for Brexit didn't even realize that it would mean the end of the UK. I guess if you're that blinkered then you deserve everything you get.
1	Brexit would have been done and dusted THREE YEARS ago if it wasn't for the filthy selfish loony left traitor nutcases. THEY are to blame.
0	This is not just about politics. This will affect the lives of many people. Brits that have worked in the European Union will now be considered a foreigner. No more traveling across the borders and much more. Trade. Companies that have built a business somewhere in Europe. So much that will need to be changed. I do not think when the people voted they were fully informed of the complexity!!
1	We were taken deeper into what is now the EU by successive government who did so knowing full well they were undermining our democracy and independence.
0	Here we go.... the insane right wing no deal is where we are going. This will cause utter chaos and decline in the country. Then again this is the democratic will of the people.
0	Captain blob a job has just steered the brexitanic into the iceberg and is now frantically arranging the deck chairs
1	Few days since brexit and the world hasn't ended yet then. Seems like project fear was all fake then!
1	I'm a firm supporter of Brexit, but I'll only believe it when we leave behind all EU laws, we keep our hard earned taxes and we get our waters back. Until then, this is all smoke and mirrors...
1	Peace has descended ..... welcome back the Real World ..
0	Dear UK, Close your eyes and brace for economic impact...
1	Leave the EU Now!!
1	It will take remainers years, if ever, to accept Brexit. They are glass half empty people. They will be scavenging for anything negative coming out of our media over the next year or two, ( and there will be plenty from our left wing remainer media), to pounce on, and crow over. They want Brexit to be a complete utter and dismal failure out of spite. Comments from them on here over the last couple of days alone, will bear this out.
1	I welcomed brexit for easier regulation on business yet am seeing little in that direction
1	Happy #BrexitDay
1	vote leave take back your country
0	The lies and deceit posted by brexiters seem to reflect those coming out of the Mail, Express, and Sun, telling reflection !!!
1	Best meat and poultry is British.
0	1.4 million British people have taken advantage of the right of freedom of movement in the EU. I am sure more will do so in the coming five years. I take being an EU citizen as one of possibilities and not dead-ends it is portrayed.
0	Unemployment, businesses going to the wall, price increases of 25%.Sick and tired of Little Englander idiots. Any business exporting to Europe must be horrified on what is happening
0	So according to this the only good thing about brexit is the apple business profiting
1	Returning confidence to the housing market
1	Great idea. Hope the UK gets out. Why should they support several of the loser countries who are part of the EU?
1	The uk steals doctors from poorer contries in the EU, these contries need thier doctors, so it would be in the best intrest for the rest of the EU if the UK leaves.
0	I think even the most ardent of Brexit voters would agree that whatever deal happens, the UK will face interim economic damage.
1	Yep, a 'small' country.... albeit a first world economy with world wide reach, but a 'small' country. A country with close ties with a still huge Commonwealth, even today, But a 'small' country. And of course, the EU is going to ignore a market of 60million in a country that was a net PROVIDER of funds that the EU needed - even if it is just a 'small' country. Yep, the UK has a lot to fear in the big wide world as a mere 'small' country, even though it's wealth will be its own in future rather than a bottomless pit that the EU can milk ad lib. Bottom line - the UK will decide its own future, not the partisan negative perspective of those chained to the bureaucratic mess that the EU was always going to be from day one of the experiment.
1	Celebrate your independence Britain!
0	UK leaving Europe is so sad, UK was fighting for Europe back then, for its liberation and independence, now they're leaving
0	I was born an EU citizen and have enjoyed the freedoms and privileges it brought. It's all been taken away from me, and from all the other British citizens who didn't just stay in their lounges reading the Daily Mail.
0	A dumb idea like trump's presidency
0	Brexit will be the most negative affected.
1	The ones that are not celebrating are the ones being paid by the central bank they know it will be gone soon
0	A decision of phenomenal and historic stupidity.
1	Go UK. Get your citizens to look at Brittian's history. You have a great country. Now take back your sovereignty. Get your fishing rights back. Raise the national flag. Do not listen to those naysayers.
0	Humans work together best by building broad bridges not retreating behind shallow borders.
0	Brexit UK. The mouse that tried to roar, but squeaked instead.
1	Good job Britain, this was the first step in taking your country back.
0	You brexsitters deserve for chlorine gas even for that what you did your children.
1	Satisfaction, that is what it means to me. We defeated those treacherous swine that were working against their own country and people. Today is a great day.
1	Brexit and Megxit in the same month? Make Britain Great Again!
0	Brexit has been about nothing but the Tories putting their own electoral survival ahead of the interests of the country.'Getting  Brexit done' was just a euphemism for 'keeping the Tories in power' and  if that means throwing the country under the bus then so be it.
1	It’s insulting to hear this news presenter say it’s not likely Britain will become America’s 51st state. Its ignorant insults like that which will make Britain a success. You really underestimate my country.
1	Now stand with Scotland and Irland.
1	Welcome to the UK from Europe and good bye to EU membership
1	Something truly remarkable is going to happen.
0	Brexit Day, now upon us, feels like the end of hope, a moral collapse, a self-amputation that will make the country where I grew up poorer in every sense
0	Actually poor British people have the most to lose from a no deal Brexit. Including many of the idiots who were cheering it on Friday night.
1	We were fed up by being ruled by the EU now where out at last no more paying u lot our uk money. 🤣👍👍👍
1	Go Britain! Now we need a Hungary exit!
0	Why does the Prime Minister insist that "we have a deal, a great deal", when it is obvious that a trade deal is still under negotiation.
1	Best decision in the last 5 decades...bye EU, and hello Europe!
0	Voting remain, it's pretty like that if with leave, Scotland will want  independence in order to be in the EU. This will result in a constant  Tory government as Scotland's vote for Labour is vital in preventing the  Conservatives (as can be seen in the last election). Being from the  North, that idea terrifies me
1	Clean break Boris is what we voted for, nothing more, we want to go WTO
1	Congrats to the United Kingdom from the Heart of Europe for your newly gained independence. May the UK prosper and grow and succeed in adressing all the challanges and internal problems it has.
0	I have the same reasoning as someone from the north of England. Northern cities receive so much funding from the EU while Westminster would rather see us rot. So much regeneration in places like Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle came about because of Objective One EU funding. I'm scared that leaving will bring about another Thatcherite annihilation of the north.
1	Who cares? We're gone now. That's all that matters.
1	The UK was always a Trojan horse for American interests and objected to any type of deep integration in the EU.  Overall, this is a great day for the EU. This will lead to closer integration and better European institutions.
0	A tragic day for the UK.
0	We're not self sufficient enough that's why. We import alot of food from abroad. Import alot of manufactured goods.
0	Brexit bad
1	The EU was a bad idea from day one!!
0	Good luck Brits! I hope that you have a good amount of money saved up. The GBP could suffer a massive devaluation over the next 5 years.
0	Woke up to the reminder I'm no longer European. Forgive my unusual lapse into hard-core profanity, but fuck brexit and everyone that voted for it.
0	Would brexiters care to tell us when that deal was signed off . No one in the EU knows about it. Brexiters dont you just love them
0	UK is about to learn an important lesson - what happens when you give power to poets and historians.
1	TRUTH: The English bow before NO ONE!
1	Just don't betray the fishermen Boris whatever you do. We are an island nation surrounded by seas. The decimation of our fishing industry has been the greatest travesty of our membership of the EU. Fishing ports and villages reduced to historical tourist relics. Our seas are not up for discussion. Our fishermen are not bargaining chips. Don't sell them up the river.
1	This is a celebration about it finally being over
1	Brexit doesn't mean the UK is going to cut it's mooring and drift a thousand miles away into the Atlantic, we're still europeans just not a part of their silly political project.
0	Voting to leave the EU was foolhardy
0	I was completely shocked by the Brexit result. 60% of the voters in my city and 62% of the voters in Scotland voted to remain in the EU so I thought it would be a clear win for "remain" but I hadn't realised just how pro-leave the rest of the UK was.  In the Scottish independence referendum, I voted for Scotland to stay part of the UK because I wasn't convinced that the potential benefits of independence outweighed the potential negatives. Now though, I think I probably would prefer to be in the EU to being in the UK, if I had to choose just one of them.  I've no idea what will happen. There's a general election next month where, presumably, Scotland will elect fifty-odd SNP MPs again and the UK will end up with a Conservative government so people here will feel unrepresented.
0	I feel so let down by the people who could vote and decided to put their own personal hatred before others. Maybe this vote was too big for this country to handle. Throughout this all I supported remain and feel upset and angry over this result. Everyone my age will be left to deal with the consequences of this and I couldn’t even have a say in it.  Evidence is showing the impact already over this, with the fall in the pound and I fear the worst is yet to come. I fail to understand why people aged 60 and above feel aggrieved by the apparent threats immigrants cause like lack of jobs and homes when they are already living comfortably with their pensions and houses when it’s young people who would be impacted by this, although I don’t personally feel like we are, yet people my age have no say.
0	I have absolutely no doubt that there were many people who made a well thought out, educated decision about leaving & I genuinely respect that. But truth be told, the vast majority who voted leave did so out of a primitive patriotism & with no understanding of the implications.
1	Just get us out Boris. At any price. The EU is generating more ill-will nowadays than peace.
0	Ideally MEPs should vote against this as the British people haven't yet had a free fair,safe,legitimate Referendum on whether to Remain in or Leave the EU!The EU Referendum in 2016 was very close, extremely corrupted, unsafe and illegitimate & we shouldn't be leaving the EU on the basis of that corrupted vote! Vote Leave and Leave.EU broke our Laws including huge overspending in regulated period!
1	I had a brexit party yesterday it was pretty cool ngl but everyone had to leave at 11PM
0	Watched the news yesterday and they interviewed some people in in pro Brexit areas as to what their thoughts wereAlmost all responses involved either:Happy we won't be oppressed by Euro law anymoreHappy we won't send Brussels money anymoreYet  none of them could actually explain what laws oppressed them (and yes  they really used the term oppressed) or how knew much money the UK got  from Europe.The most telling bit  was when it was pointed out that one of the big subsidized projects in  Cornwall would no longer get money from the European grant the response  was:  Well then our government will just have to fund that.I honestly cannot wait for the boomer generation to no longer be part of the electorate.
1	When Brexit won, I smiled the whole day
1	I think it's time for the UK to prioritise it's citizens. What is the use of having your own Parliament if the EU will not respect or honour your country's law?
1	Here here Nigel!!
0	Brexteers, you don't get to tell others how to feel; we don't want to get behind your actions; there is no healing and there will not be until we rejoin; so get over it and live with the consequences of YOUR ACTIONS
1	Make UK Great Again.
1	We never voted to be ruled by a third party.
0	The Brexit is going to be a disaster for the U.K. It's not too late to stop the Brexit now, but time is running out for the U.K.
1	Finally, a country with our own democracy. No more stupid EU laws like: Stiliton cheese cannot be produced in Stilton or Bananas need to be a certain curvature or dead fish thrown back in the sea because of quotas
0	Bing bong the environment is gone
0	Russia and China want a Brexit, it’ll weaken Europe’s unity which will make them easier to take over.
1	It's no surprise that Boris's sense of 'can do' is appreciated by voters frustrated by the tricks and shenanigans of a Remainer-dominated Parliament that declines to honour the outcome of the referendum.
0	Who can we blame next to get a war started! How in Gods name could someone working for Japanese car companies vote for Brexit when they were told it would cost them their jobs.
0	I voted remain as I used to live on the continent. Concessions for Cameron would have avoided all of this. Learn your lessons EU. Dont treat member states as your property and listen to the people not corporations.
0	A sad day.  More years of even worse financial hardship to come. Hopefully it won't take too long to rejoin. My European flag will be prominently on display until that day comes.
1	47 years of eu membership has done nothing for the uk
1	I also voted in 1975 to remain in a 'Common Market' not in the European Union which didn't exist at the time. We were conned by Heath and the establishment and a terrible wrong has been righted.
1	The governments have done nothing to control the abuse of cheap labour until the Brexit vote
1	The EU are now terrified of a resurgent UK with a vibrant economy, free to trade with the world, right on their doorstep.
1	England shaking off the merchant micers of it's back.
1	I hope this is the start of the "Domino effect".. Enough wasted hard working tax payers money given to the EU gravy train.
0	Brexit has a good chance of breaking up the uk.
1	The UK should should not be held back by the EU as there are more opportunities beyond Europe. So much more potential within the Commonwealth countries alone.
0	Looking forward to all the thick racists who voted for Brexit working for a shilling a day until they're too old, after which they can beg in the streets.
1	Congratulations & respect for you and your party, you took on the establishment, media (corrupt BBC) and saved us from the clutches of the European Army. Thank you
1	The best news today.
0	It's interesting... I hope it works out for you guys. I honestly thought that you all would have another year until you left. To be honest I have my doubts about this. I'm afraid for your economy, your NHS, and Northern Ireland.     But I'm truly rooting for you guys! Just maybe worried.
0	i see prices of items/foods are gonna go up next year
1	Thank God for Nigel Farage!  At last someone who speaks sense, a voice for Freedom and Democracy.  Sorry you were not very visible on national TV last night, there were more weather forecasts and remoaners lamenting Brexit than scenes of joy.  This is a major historical/joyful occasion where our Democratic rights have FINALLY won through.  The backdrop of a BBC newsroom surrounded by blue and yellow stars was appalling.  The next step should be to change the stranglehold over our media and stamp out the negative propaganda and state run broadcasting machine.  Give us some clean, clear facts we can see through the garbage.  Thanks Nigel from the bottom on my heart.
1	Congrats to every Person in the UK. You will lead the way. After this we can hope that many others will follow. Once again the UK leads the way. You led the way in WWI WWII now you lead the way from another Globalest push. You the people of the UK demanded your National sovereignty back and you have it.
1	UK IS BETTER OF ON IS OWN.. THANK YOU BRITAIN for leading by example .. u guys are going to be ok.. next make GOD a priority and the ppl of God..
0	Is Brexit done yet? Thought not.
0	Why are #Brexit supporters still angry? They've "won" haven't they! Or maybe they've just always been angry and nothing will ever please them!
0	I want to be with EU
0	Brexit wasnt a rational argument for something, it was an emotional argument against something perceived as bad.
1	Goodbye UK; you won't be missed.
0	I've had my Europeaness taken away
1	John Curtis polls voters about certain Eu regulations. Turns out voters like them.
0	After signing the agreement, Mr Michel said that "things will inevitably change but our friendship will remain".   "We start a new chapter as partners and allies," he said.   Hmm, it seems like only days ago the rhetoric from Brussels was of punishment for the UK.  What's changed? Maybe a realisation that when it comes to trade we both benefit from co-operation. Of course with an annual surplus of £94bn the EU27 benefit a bit more than we do.
0	Now that the “Brexiteers / Leavers” have “won” they are very angry. As things get progressively worse in the U.K. they will get angrier. There is no good reason to Brexit.
0	I feel bad for the average brits who have been sold a lie but since the only way out is to admit that, then the next option is to see this through to it conclusion.
1	Congratulations to all of my friends in the UK. Now you will be able control your own destiny and deside who immigrates into your country and why !
1	The question was "is the UK a nation?" The people answered..."Yes it is".
1	The EU are taking all our jobs, fishing, steel, just two, did you know that the EU paid for ford transit factory to move to TURKEY more jobs gone, and other companies have gone all in the passed and now we are out they will pay for lots more to go over there. Now the EU want to kill Briton
1	Freedom at last !! UK for the British !!! Independent, well DONE all who fought against the global establishment !!
0	Dont blame them, get rid of Boris the Liar and stop in the EU, what a perfect scenario
1	I think the EU is structurally and economically unsound, utterly and completely resistant to change, lacking in transparency, possibly even corrupt, and ultimately will collapse.
0	Johnson could have tried to heal the divisions. Instead he’s preparing the ground to blame #EU once #Brexit damage is clear & he's been found out by the masses who voted for him. #BrexitLies
1	The EUrines will continue to weep, threaten and sweat incessantly. Nothing new. Brexit will progress until fully completed.  Thank goodness.  Out means out and so be it.
0	For Johnson, Gove, and the rest, it's now all quiet on the Brexit benefits and assurances front. All the promises are forgotten. It's simply doing the will of the people. Thier attempt to escape blame will rightly fail.
1	The UK should leave the EU now the so called ‘reforms’ are a pathetic attemt at to fool the UK into staying for us then to realise we are diminished into a state on a larger united states of europe which i do not want an never will
1	WAVE those flags high Brits! Congratulations FREEDOM RINGS!
0	Ffs this is gonna backfire 4 sure
1	There seems to be some part of 'Independent Sovereign Nation' that the EU doesn't understand. Until they stop trying to treat us as some kind of semi-detached member, this is going nowhere.
1	Now we need someone to lead a movement to end mass immigration.
0	Johnson is a complete buffoon- a combination of bluffing/bullying and lying has got him where he is- and where we are, sinking beneath the waves.
0	If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will be a relative economic disaster for us all. The only way for those of us who remember life outside the EU to show you, is for the millions who dont know to vote to leave! Go for it. Theres no way back. And as many of us have been saying, with a certain amount of inside 'info', EU businesses employing UK citizens WILL relocate. Hundreds of thousands of jobs lost. Do this referendum soon. Then Cameron will have to shoulder the mess. Along with us.
0	Brexshit will make Britain a USA puppet more.
0	fantastic video, brexit is a travesty
0	"Wow this passport's fancy. Must have some kickass features. How many countries do you have the right to work in on this bad boy?"
1	Idiots and traitors.
0	Let chaos reign. Scotland and Northern Ireland don't want to play your big ego games. You despise the EU so much, and because of it, all the UK will have to pay for it. The EU should just give you no deal, no bail out. You and Nigel deserve every bit of pain. The people don't.
1	The revolution has started : Let's continue with Denxit, Swexit and Nedxit.
1	The pro eu campaign is just scare stories based upon discredited reports.
0	Does this mean that I have to leave the UK now?
0	I personally think Brexit is just a pep talk that will never happen and that should not happen for the lives of 500 million people.We should be the ones to make changes not the MP, us, we need to make the world a better place,a safer place!
0	The Brexiteer school of debating - keep shouting …
0	Sorry kids. You've been lied to by the LEAVEs. This is the way the rich elite and powerful keep the 'quiet ones' in line. The elite and rich who own papers like the DM have spun stories and spouted rhetoric that 'independence' is going to benefit you. But by leaving we give the elite more control and making them richer. We working classes will be worse off. Despite what they tell us. Immigrants pay more in tax than they claim. It's the rich and 'austerity' who are keeping it. Not people who are coming to our country because we voted to bomb them back in December. Wake up to the lies.
1	EU neoliberalism was taking us backward fast
0	No way, hon. I'm straight, white, a boomer, a Brexit supporter and voted Conservative. I'm the Devil.
1	Good for Britain. Brexit is just like 1776  for America.
0	God you Brexiters talk shite. It's like some induced dream you all live in, which is why the divisions brewing in this nation will only worsen.
1	The EU will no longer be able to cause problems in the UK anymore.
0	From now on, Brits are no longer EU citizens. They've lost all the rights, protections & benefits that come with EU membership. Half a billion neighbours have those rights. But UK Leavers have sold ours for a blue passport and a 50p piece.
1	BREXIT is not a problem its the vile EU
1	I desire to leave because I want the final authority in this country to be westminster, not brussels.  I want the UK to control its own fisheries, not bow and lend them to the rest of the EU.  I want the UK to decide who comes into this country, not every other EU member state.  Self determination is more important than short term GDP.
0	I met a lad at the pub hosting 'Brexit Night' celebrations who said he knew little about the EU, 'didn't really do politics', and admitted that he was only there for the free curry. I told him "well then, you'll be glad to know that you won't now be called up for the EU army." He looked a bit stunned.
0	This Irish woman will have to eat her words when Ireland votes YET AGAIN to leave and Varadkar is history! Free Ireland.â˜˜ï¸
1	It is the piecewise different sound bites on proBrexit Nigel, etc. they’ve heard strung together into a train of incoherency. I did a better job in a complete presentation fail not having read the book for a class at 12 years of age cheating and using the abbreviated Cliff Notes
1	Yes, and what relevance does that have with us leaving a fascist super state? #brexit
1	Its not Brexit that we should be celebrating. Far more important is returning democracy to the people.
0	Those who argue for Brexit are wrong, and that is because they have not been properly informed about the costs.
0	Shame on you if you were a part of this
1	It's really difficult for us to change our tariffs to prevent manufacturers in other countries from simply finding loopholes to get around our tariffs.
0	Millions of profits for some individuals and billions of profits for some banks and companies ...if the exact moments of those words are known in advance ??
1	The EU have been scamming us for decades, moving our manufacturing, collecting our import tariffs from around the world and pocketing it, building up Rotterdam whilst our ports disintegrate, tendering our defence out so Spain and others build our war ships.   Tony Blair and his Liberal types are an embarrassing sell out for this country.
1	The #LabourParty of true democracy defenders like Benn Shore & Castle has gone. Labour's Eurosceptic heartlands are now told by the party's London elite NOT to vote Labour. You heard #AndrewAdonis vote for a genuine #ProBrexit party in the coming elections
0	Vote to stay in the EU!
1	Soooo let me get this right..Leavers voted for Brexit to make this country great again
1	Ha ha. No TLDR celebrations? Showing your true colours. Happy Brexit day everyone.
1	So we have to do what the EU tells us, but the EU ignores anything we tell them. Just like old times really, which is why we are where we are.
1	Merry Brexit one and ALL....4 years and we finally got there.
1	Get the immigration stopped then it will be a real Brexit send 80 per sent back crime will stop houses will become available to British people all that rubbish I hear about we need them ect 90 per cent of the ones they have moved into my area are claiming benefits and robbing the system and running about in disability cars  they are treating us like fools
1	Never darken our doorstep again EU. Rotten, socialist project that has failed.
1	Members of the EU hierarchy are akin to those of the Labour Party.  They refuse to acknowledge the real reason why the majority of Brits voted to leave.   Prior to the campaigning for the 2016 referendum, most Brits were not bothered one way or another about our membership of the EU.  Then we had project fear, the odious behaviour of Osborne, Carney and their cronies got us all thinking 'what are they trying to hide'?  Then Cameron  went to negotiate his concessions that were so meaningless that nobody understood what they meant - remember the 'emergency brake'?   Post 2016 referendum, the behaviour of Juncker, Tusk & Co in publicly humiliating Theresa May, when she was in fact desperate to stay in the EU, irritated a lot of the British electorate.  Their total unwillingness to enter into any realistic negotations stalled the whole process.   More recently, the threats and the attempted bullying coming our way from the EU, made even the most moderate Brit glad that we are leaving this corrupt and hopelessly out of touch organisation.
0	British do not come to Spain for vacations please, bye bye!
0	I have one finger on each hand reserved for Brexit and the Senate. I’ll let you guess which ones.
0	Ty. That's perfectly honest Ahh...you forgot the Russia Report ! Where's the fucking Russia Report, Boris ?
1	The British people are not made for the EU. The GOD designed them to rule the world.
1	Great night had by patriots, keep the English flag flying high
1	To be clear, you can't be #probrexit and not #ProBreakUp, the arguments are almost identical. It's time for Wangland to get a new flag.
1	Truth is Interpol EU Nato UN: none of it makes you safe from a terrorist attack. #brussels Thoughts with families and emergency services
1	Britannia is going through a transition, next year it's Britannicus. N'kay
1	BRAVO, England. I didn't actually think you'd end up leaving so I was thrilled when I awoke that morning and heard the news. Independence. It's great. Now get back your rights to free speech, freedom of religion in the public square, and most importantly, your right to bear arms.
0	In 1739, Sir Robert Walpole said "They ring their bells now, but before long they will be wringing their hands".
1	Only Germany matters, all the others are coat tail hangers.
0	Good bye Europe I am so sad to be leaving you, you will be forever in my heart. ❤️🇪🇺
1	Please god END THIS Weve had enough Brexit 31st and MOVE ON
0	Brexit is fascism. Whenever people say such statements are exagerated, they're complicit. How bad is bad enough for the English to be able to face their own mess? Where do the English draw the line, gas chambers? Fascism does not require the existence of gas chambers, it's nevertheless still fascism. English nationalism is extremism. Brexit is embryonic fascism. It should've been recognized as such and aborted long ago. It has now metastasized and the English and their cowardnes are responsabile.
1	Match fixed
0	Imagine #brexit being a #psychiatricdiagnosis (which it kind of is), today is a day when safeguarding would mean #sectioningtheuk against potential #harm to self/EU/others.... as it’s incapable of making rational decisions... & needs to stabilise
1	FREEEEEEEEEEEDOM!
1	Lets get rid of all the EU flags in the UK.
0	I lived in England for five years back in the 80s and loved it. Kills me to see it turn to shit over ignorance.
0	The retoric is lovely. But the key is that he want's to have his cake and eat it. No. Out is out. Stop moaning.
1	EU is pure evil
1	Tbh, I find the EU irritating. So the less influence it has, the better.
0	Brexit and it's associated world view are embryonic fascism that has now metastasized, aided by English passivity and cowardness
1	We have to VOTE LEAVE for freedom and Democracy away from the Euro Project Dictatorship
1	Let’s all take a moment to remember Dominic Cummings as one of the masterminds behind the victorious Brexit campaign and for his efforts in securing the vote.
0	The #Brexiters have attacked the EU incessantly for 47 years . Now they have had their way, they can't expect pro-EU people to shut up just because #Brexiters ask for it especially when #Brexit is wrecking their jobs, their prospects, prosperity and their health. #FBPE
1	This Is England, Returned to a Sovereign Nation. Maybe one day, Europe will change its behavior.  TRUMP for British Prime Minister!!!
0	Be careful. If you remain negative, and then Brexit leads to a terrible outcome for the country, your lack of positivity will be held up as why it went badly!
0	DEDICATED TO ALL REMAINERS TONIGHT: "Just remember in the winter, far beneath the bitter snows Lies the seed, that with the sun's love in the spring becomes the rose." You're not alone. It's not the end.
0	Brexit was a mistake from the get-go
0	Welcome to the United States of Great Britain. Enjoy your watered down employee protection laws, lower standards of food safety and, of course, a completely privatised health care system (or, at the very least, a health care system that has been portioned off to for-profit private companies with minimal oversight - much like those efficient privatised rail franchises). Greatest own-goal in modern history. Have fun with that.
0	I would laugh about it, if it wasn't so depressing. To start with, they made yes/no referendum about a way to complex matter, had a very close result, following a campaign full of misinformation and falls promises. To fulfill these promises would mean to get all the benefits of the EU without any of the obligations, which is ridiculous. May could have gone on and work with the parliament, to reach a deal with the EU to be a country like Norway (Very close in the EU, but not part of it). Instead she just ignored Parliament until the end, made a terrible compromise deal to fulfil some of the dumb promises made. Now parliament doesn't want that deal, no one wants a no-deal Brexit, but the time is running out and and a delay would result in the same problem just a few months later. It's just a total disaster from beginning to end.
1	As dyed in the wood Brexiteer, had best breakfasts in Germany got many friends whilst working there fer 15 plus years,am a HARDEND eu hater,but Germany was OK just the eu mafia is the problem,just saying
0	Gosh. A tax cut. How the brexit gullibles will cheer.
1	Congratulations to all of my friends in the UK.  Now you will be able control your own destiny and deside who immigrates into your country and why !
1	I decided to vote leave at the last minute, I had been vote remain for the entire campaign but I couldn’t stand the idea of waking up tomorrow with nothing being done about the EU’s lack of democracy and lack of accountability. I am very restrained and humble right now and I understand that our country will experience a tough period but I’m hopeful for the future and my prospects as a young person.
0	May have fucked the country but we'll be fine... In nearly half a century...  DUUUUUUUURRRRRRRR
1	I haven't met any racist remain voters. Just like I've met plenty of leave voters who aren't racist.
0	EU should keep negotiating and stalling while the UK continues to pay their dues the rest of the year, then go full WTO on the UK.
0	Brits have been very negative on Trump and Republican policies. Pot, meet kettle.
1	good choice uk, good choice
0	The brexiters might have won, but they have lost a United Kingdom.
0	Someone said that Britain is the first country to impose economic sanctions on itself. To quote from 'Game of Thrones vol1'- "The long summer is over, winter is coming".
1	Get out while you can England!!!
0	Yup, all that and more is written into the Political Declaration, and Boris signed it. A bad mistake, but are we surprised.
1	we will not be slaves no more no more EU rules
1	I hope they ban these EU trolls from posting on these comment boards in the near future. They've surely outlived their usefulness. To my fellow Brexiteers, I wish you a Happy UK independence Day,
0	I'm UK, and I never wanted brexit.
0	The youth of Spain are not against the E.U. They do not blame the E.U., but the Spanish government. You know nothing about Spain and continental Europe.
1	Looks like they want far more from us than we do from them ie we have the upper hand.
0	it is at best pointless and fantastically expensive, and at worst disastrous for Britain politically, economically and socially.
0	Brexit is and will continue to be lies and fantasy nonsense, blaming the EU and remainers and taking no responsibility whatsoever. Johnson is playing to the domestic gallery, relying on the stupidity of many of his supporters and believe you me, many of them haven't a clue. This was predictable.
0	It’s remarkable that so many people genuinely believe Brexit is done and dusted. To those people I say show me what has changed when I wake up tomorrow morning.  Everyone else can look forward to at least 12 more months (more like a few years) of wrangling about a trade deal in which we will come out losers, either because we couldn’t agree a deal or because we make stupid decisions on things like fishing.
0	When I heard the cheering Brexiteers sing "England rules the waves", I knew the situation was much, much worse than I initially believed it to be.  When whole hoards of people don’t understand how insulting and degenerated it is to sing exactly this song, then indeed, we are back in Germany 1930’s.  That song is only to be associated with war, oppression, theft on a global scale, bloodshed...   Shame upon those terribly low-life elements, shame!
0	None of this drama would have been necessary if we had Remained. The Brexiters are drama queens. Anything for a bit of high theatre including especially the disruption of millions of people's ordinary lives. For nothing. Sovereignty my aunt Jemima!
0	Funny thing about Brexit Logic is its selective denial/adoption of logical reciprocity.…
1	HISTORIC: Today, #Britain quit the European Union and regained control of its own country! National sovereignty is always a great thing. #BrexitDay
1	I think they way that the EU is structured, with, I have no doubt, high corruption swept under the carpet, then they are incapable of negotiating in good faith. Too many special ' favours' to look after.
0	brexit is the worst possible thing for our country
1	The consequences are pro and con, pro the UK is no longer anchored to an unaccountable body with opaque and corrupt governance, the con being the UK is free of an unaccountable body with corrupt governance. Condemned to be free is perhaps not the worst fate imaginable. Doubtless Merkel and Hollande are both spitting chips, but I don't see where there was ever any guarantee of a gravy train with rails that ran forever.
0	Fuck my shitty country
0	Brexit is an unmitigated disaster and I loathe and detest Cameron’s lazy, incompetent, irresponsible and ignorant approach to the referendum
1	We're not leaving Europe, we are leaving the European Union
0	A second referendum is better than sticking to a vote made in ignorance
0	95% of us in the EU countries meant it
1	I am old enough to remember the UK BEFORE we joined the EU. I for one couldn't be happier to be out of it! Now we can get back to some common sense, making our own laws once again, and looking after our own affairs, instead of being dictated to, and having our wealth squandered on European projects!
1	Great Britons are NOT Euro-Peons
1	the problem is that we also have the problem of manufacturing jobs going to countries with lower wages for example Romania
1	Well done Boris!
1	FREEDOM!!!!!!
1	The UK is no longer under the thumb of the EU! Hopefully the rest of Europe follows and the EU falls!
0	Sad I picture a tearful Merkel and Macron gazing at the sunset, holding hands. As for GREAT Britain EU gone , Meghan gone, things are looking up. God bless the Brits
0	Norton Motorcycles Brexiter Boss in 2018: "We are better prepared for brexit than the media would have you believe." Norton Motorcycles Brexiter Boss in March 2019: "Brexit has kicked us up the backside". January 29th 2020. Norton Motorcycles goes into administration.  A classic British engineering company lost to this racism and tory tax dodgers greed.
1	Let's just leave, its more fun LOL!
0	England can stand alone. not like the countries in the EU..They like it in their comfort zone.
1	Makes ME all kinds of proud and I live in Alabama! I love seeing decent, good folk prosper!
0	The BBC have been told not to use the word BREXIT presumably to support the lie that we got it. Just watch....and you wondered how an entire nation could be fooled to enthusiastically back fascism in the 30s. That moment when the lie is so big, it couldn’t possibly be a lie...
1	Why do the looney fanatical little europeaners, think that being in the EU club is the world! When we leave your little meaningless power grab, we will be back in the world .
1	Please stop telling us EU is utopia because we don’t care wether it is or not.
1	Canary Wharf alone is substantially larger than the EU's largest financial centre - Frankfurt
1	Brexit was never simply about trade because the EU isn't simply about trade!
1	Saddened by reports from Brussels, but the message is clear, we are not safer in Europe #brexit #voteleave
0	I'm one of those weirdos who believes that the recent wave of immigration and our membership of the EU have been wholly beneficial to the UK. I'm even more weird in knowing that official data backs me up.
1	Congratulations from the US.
0	The closer we come to the Greek tragedy that is Brexit, the more horrifying it is to behold.
1	Cheers Britain!!! Enjoy your Freedom from the EU totalitarians!!
1	Excellent ! ...now all the useless EU bureaucrats & politicians will HAVE to actually work for a change in order to keep other countries from leaving as well.
0	Looks like Boris was so determined to blow Brexit that he doesn't have a clue as to what happens next. You did it now lets see what you got?
1	Happy Independence Day ! Thank you to all those who believe in Britain - Proud to live in this country that respects democracy :)
0	The fight to #StopBrexit is over but the fight for our values continues. Our campaign created a powerful movement for an open, tolerant and outward looking Britain. We will continue to fight for those beliefs
1	I can imagine,that the EU will try to scold Britain for being defiant. And won't let you play in their games. As an American I hope we triple our trade's with Britain!
1	Shrink it? I don't give a toss. An economy cannot increase forever. I would have an exit from the EU, and complete withdrawal from any refugee/asylum seeker/economic migrant acceptance quotas.
0	Boris and his gang of idiots also seem to be labouring under the misapprehension that because they won an election in the UK with the help of their friends in the press, that they will also be able to do the same thing with negotiations with the EU
1	For us it was what we voted for and was not a mistake. For the EU it was a mistake because if they had given a little something to David Cameron then I have no doubt we, the UK would have voted to remain. Thank god they did not give us anything!
1	I am clearly raising a few pints of Irish and English beer tonight!!! Congratulations Great Britain . Now you can work on becoming “great again “ !!!!! Cheers !!!!
1	I voted for a fair immigration policy. My wife is a non-EU citizen from Thailand and we are discriminated against. If I didn’t earn £20,000 or more – the required figure – the choice would be to claim benefits and then when it came to my wife’s visa renewal she would have to leave. Her visa costs almost £1,500 every every two-and-a-half years.  Cameron has only himself to blame. He thought he could bully the electorate, the same as in the Scotland referendum, but forgot that nobody is enthused or patriotic about the EU and millions hate him. I also don’t like to be told by governments and businesses how to vote, that’s why we have a secret vote. There’s a lot of anger against Cameron.  I think any xenophobia and racism is stirred up more by the remain side, not the leave side. I am very much in favour of a fair immigration policy. The Australian points system was a big deciding factor for me. I’m not sure if it would be any easier for my wife under the points system. Depends on the level, but I would hope as a British citizen I wouldn’t be discriminated against.  I’m very happy with the result, it should keep all of them occupied for years and less time to start picking fights around the world.
1	Good trade deal with US will be good for the Enland we once knew
1	thank god we have left this wretched institution. Look at the contempt they hold for our flag. We will make a success of brexit and be the envy of this stangnant, dead in the water, undemocratic empire.
1	The EU is a good idea but not if it is a socialist country. Britain demands the right to vote them out and as for France, Va T’ en Macron!
1	Lot of moaners in the comments but the thumbs up are 2 to 1 compared to the downs; about the same ratio as the Great British Public's choice.
0	The UK is shooting itself in the face and taking the rest of us with them.
0	If they start building a wall in ireland things will get nasty
1	Brexit is a step forward for our nation.
1	One of the best days of my life when those results came in.
1	The UK has regained her liberty, freedom, & Autonomy. Now she can represent her own citizens interests!!!!
1	Seems the EU is really showing their fear and their contempt for democracy.
1	So basic the failure was letting those dastardly Brits escape.
0	Pro-tip for anyone who burned an EU flag and objects to being called thick and racist. If you stop being xenophobic, thick and racist then you will not be called xenophobic, thick and racist. It's not quantum mathematics people.
0	sadly, the people will still prefer to hear the comforting lie over the uncomfortable truth. The UK becomes less important by the day
1	how about organising a mass lighting of all the armada beacons on the coasts and islands facing Europe so the Euros can see the UK Brexit victory!
0	Going the wrong route. Should cancel this self destruct button knows as "Brexit". Only chaos waits UK now. Its like committing suicide knowing the consequences.
1	Can't wait til 5 years time when we have a referendum to join again
1	The best thing that has happened to this country since I been alive any way  Long live the commonwealth
1	It was a vote, done democratically, in which the minority vote is attempting to overthrow the will of the voters. They call that something, it rhymes with facism.
0	The Queen has signed the Withdrawal Agreement. The EU Commission and Council presidents have signed it. Now just requires the approval of the European Parliament in the vote at 6pm next Wednesday. Lib Dems will vote against but it will pass
0	How can you celebrate it ???What’s this ???New Year’s Eve ??Sick .The united is the key .Think WAR and you change your mind when is too late .
1	So the EU position is to try and make ex members follow its standards? Wasn't this kind of meddling what caused the whole mess in the first place.
1	If we stay in the EU and give more and more power to the EU over the UK then what? We would have the Germans, French and Dutch making decisions for us with their populations which together far outnumber the British.
0	I am devastated that we are leaving the EU shame on all of you that voted leave
1	We should celebrate our escape from this badly thought out EU project. It was not what we signed up for all those years ago. I for one will end my dry January with drink or 2.
0	Brexit was a hatred vote. Hatred of immigrants, foreigners, the EU and Muslims. No good can ever come of such negativity and Britain will sadly pay a terrible collective price unless it changes its mind.
1	From the Netherlands: Congratulations with your regained freedom. Tonight you will be free of EU slavery!!!!!
0	Sad sad day. End of an era. However Brexit is a generational thing and it won’t be long before the pro EU young are in the majority and can claim their access rights back. Every dog has its day.
1	Lol they should have pulled his mic years ago. About time hahaha
1	Next 5 years of prosperous trade and friendship between UK and US... Will be the inevitable capital sentence for the corrupt and senile EU
0	Bad. We left the EU In control of our armed forces and intelligence services.
1	Thank goodness we are finally leaving, hopefully the radical left will now calm down...
1	The EU has always operated a give and take policy We give They take
0	Still waiting for the Brexit plan from the Brexiters. Do we still hold all the cards, in this game of chess?
0	It's literally like shooting one's self in the foot. Dumb AF
1	These member countries lost sovereignty and to me that's never a good thing.
1	Great Britain is more than just a star on someone else's flag
1	“Brexit preparation will be a competitive differentiator. Those who have failed to prepare will find it harder to attract investor support, recruit staff, find the right warehousing or meet customer expectations over the long term.”
1	Happy Independence Day, Britain.   You are never alone.
1	It’s unfortunate that the United Kingdom despises Europe but at least it will be leaving very soon.
0	You talk of dialogue, dialogue and more bloody dialogue, how long has the UK been in 'dialogue' with the monstrous leviathan that is the inept body EU?
1	EUSSR Shortest lived empire in history.
1	The UK wants be free by laws EU...  Chuchill be proud...
0	Remain. I have a full range of economic, political and social arguments for remaining a member of the EU. But, it all boils down to - I don't want to live on a planet where Nigel Farage is right.
1	If the EU trys to lay guidelines we wont , alternate Nations will , and will benefit from filling the gap lol
1	Just like WW1. We got a victory in the end.
1	And Terror begins
0	Switzerland is fine and it never joined the EU
1	Italians supporting Brexit ! god bless UK ! keep being master of your fate
0	This is the beginning of the end of the EU
0	Brexit is, and always has been a complete waste of time and effort - unless you are either a right-wing, pro-American free market capitalist, or a dyed in the wool English nationalist, or you're just plain fed up with being taken for granted by politicians of whatever stripe and want to register a protest.
1	Demand a full indipendent audit of EUs account's before we pay another penny to this rancid pile of filth!
1	It's better to die free, than live as a slave."
1	The PEOPLE ARE FULLY BACKING BORIS. WE WON THE WAR AGAINST THE EU , BUT WE STILL STAND WITH THE EUROPEAN CITIZENS.
0	Eu is good,broke uk
1	Hey Britain, the USA is here, ready and want to do business with our cousins. Everything you've relied on the EU for we have in abundance and we can do it better. Give US a chance.
0	So instead of controlling our borders we could end up letting literally anyone in due to this brexit blunder?! Congratulations, Brexiteers.
1	We survived before we went into the Common Market...we will survive after we leave the EU...all we need is the chance.
0	Maybe if we had just named the EU differently, something like the "New Commonwealth" or "Even Greater Britain", all of this nonsense could have been avoided.
0	Britain will go into depression and the E.U will bloom...there is always another side to a coin.
0	If anyone is dreaming, it is you. The UK economy is about 1/7th of the EU. EU exports to the UK are 10% of the total (but nearly 50% of the UK's total exports). Regardless of the outcome, this won't disappear, but perhaps diminish, let's say to 5% in the worst case scenario. It is safe to say that the EU will be quite able to take a hit of 5%, whereas the UK will struggle to take a 25% hit to its exports. Moreover, the UK's main export is services which won't be covered by any FTA; the EU mainly exports goods, which will be covered. Yet again, you show the utter ignorance of brexiters in all matters of economi
0	Not paying member fee has to have consequences (the EU is not the BBC). So - the deal the UK can get from the EU will be worse by that amount relative to what the UK had while a member.
1	Congratulations, you guys finally decided you didn’t want to slaves after all. Now, let’s see the lion roar.
1	We've been browbeaten by the Eurofanatics for 40 years but now they are getting a taste of their own medicine they don't like it.
0	Remain won. Leave voters migrate to Syria and leave us in our peace
0	Everyone in Ireland wishes ya all the best.. we hope you enjoy “taking back control” and all those fun slogans.
0	This makes me feel so bad for my kids. In a few years they’ll be in the job market, so many opportunities have been take away from them - they only have British passports. We’ve become 2nd class citizens in Europe
1	Oh she meant it all right. We mean it too, the only difference between us is that it is the EU who will need "luck".
1	Let us help Remoaners resettle abroad! Not even joking.
0	A significant cause of global warming is the hot air and noxious gases emitted by you and the other corrupt Brexit morons.
1	We are helping spread growth economy news and successes after Brexit. Please feel free to follow and help promote us.
0	Everything about it sounded corrupt and ill-informed. Risking the health of your economy and, more importantly, the integrity of you union just to curb immigration looks asinine and unnecessarily self-destructive. Good luck to yall
1	Thank god Britain is leaving in 21 days !!
0	This is an example of “don’t fix something that isn’t broken"
1	It's BS like this that show just how right we are to be getting out of the EU. Any club that treats members that wish to leave like this is no club that I want to be a part of.
0	Brexit was the dream of a few tax-avoiding millionaires with powerful allies in the media. There has not been a single provable benefit except for those who can avoid the forthcoming EU tax-avoidance directive. Millions of our electorate have been whipped up into a populist frenzy believing that somehow the EU is the enemy when in reality they have been used as puppets of the elite. Sad.
0	Does anyone still believe that Brexit wasn't about joining a race to the bottom on standards and regulations?
0	I'd feel worse that leavers have stripped him of so many opportunities for his future.
1	I will be voting to Leave because I don't like having to answer to Brussels and I want us to be able to control our own borders.
0	But the NHS will get 350 million a week from now on and we will get blue passports!
0	I hope that its absolutely clear for everybody what the consequences are when the UK is leaving te EU. The EU needs the UK, the UK needs the EU !
0	Self approval that “we are normal people “doesn’t sound convincing.
0	One week until the people of #Britain could really f**k things up for generations to come #VoteStay
1	History will show Brexit was best thing we could ever have done. Nationalism is good, it works. Nationalism is on the rise across all of Europe. France, Italy, Germany, Denmark, Netherlands...  The people of Europe never asked for a United States of Europe. Overwhelmingly they don't want it, nor will they let it happen either.  Britain was the first to leave the EU. But we won't be the last ;)
1	unions need the membership money from all the EU workers, also are we that incapable of implementing our own laws
1	Boris..its not just the leaving of the EU..but..taking decisions like this now..you will be judged on these matters the country is relying on you to get de visions like these right..for our poor fishermen.. and farmers etc,thisis what Brexit is really about..and it starts here and now.
0	It seems an absolute shit show and I can't help but wonder if, after all this trouble and doubt, some people might like to vote again.   That said, we've got enough of our own issues I'm not going to throw any stones in the foreign relations area unless someone asks.
0	Whats the betting that the UK will crash out without a deal?!
1	As a European I am happy to see GB go.
1	Brexit is the UK’s chance to save its sovereignty from the to be super-state of the EU where anti-British views are quite high in the European Parliament.
0	“The EU is enormously powerful.” This is exactly why you leave if you value sovereignty.
0	The English clearly forgot why we came together as EU: War prevention!  Also wrecking your own economy is not a smart move, that's shown by every economic analyst.
0	That is why the UK, is denied the Right to Freedom of speech.We are silenced,and have to be mindful of what we say..
1	Congratulations to Britain 🇬🇧!!! You can start living under your own laws the way YOU want.
1	We tried to get better agreements and more freedom before however we got given nothing.
1	My Brexit day yesterday was glorious.
0	The people of Britain do not know what they are doing
1	Come on, UK!  INDEPENDENCE!
0	I’m anti-Brexit but I can see no Brexit link here. If you simply blame Brexit on everything bad, you’ll dilute and mask the real effects of Brexit.
1	Good riddance to the EU snowflakes...........
1	free at last, free at last, thank god almighty we're free at last.
1	Now you have finished UK
0	Today, 100% of the population has been fucked over by 26% of the population at the behest of 1% of the population. Fuck Brexit.
0	Housing crash blamed on brexit imminent
0	Brexit is the worst political decision Britain will ever make, Britain just became worse off and the people who voted for Brexit will be the first to complain when they have less money and less standard of life. Lucky me I have 3 nationalities two being German and English.
0	Together we are stronger.
0	what seems like a good decision today, can have major implications in future and future generations will curse generation who voted now.
1	It will potentially give us more control on immigration, laws etc
0	They are singing Land of Hope and Glory over the road. Says it all - a delusional sense of national importance predominantly among the older, tabloid reading populace, has enabled a grasping billionaire elite to manipulate swathes of the electorate to bring us to this pass. Singing songs from a previous century, as if to bring back Empire (as opposed to selling us all down the river).
0	Self-centred, narrow-minded, xenophobic liars have won.
0	Lovely lot, Brexiters. And if you're not a hateful bigot, shame you chose to side with hateful bigots. And, some might say, telling.
1	Go back, why would any country on God's earth which to be part of this disgraceful EU set up. We are free and I would imagine there are others watching us very closely. We will succeed and come out of this nightmare with our country, pride and sovereignty.
1	It would be Good if people would just give Boris a chance, time for whinging is over put your EU flags away and get behind the majority of the country
1	Go Brexit!
0	The fact is the UK has always had very strong voice in the  EU, so I wonder Why they want out
1	Eu is acting like an ex who cant move on
0	Clear case of a colonial depression
0	the brexit is very bad for Great Britain. The economy of the brits has been degrading ever since the brexit and it will only get worse not better.
1	We can't trust the EU, we have never been able to trust the EU, They have no respect for the UK, So please stop refering to them as our freinds. The Ink is hardley dry on the W.A.and they are already gonig back on what they have agreed. As they have already broken the agreement we are fee to walk away.
1	Good job Boris. Get it done and over with, that way everyone can move on
0	Keep taking the blue pill.
0	Sad, angry, and scared for our country this morning.
1	The EU have gone through the three most destructive phases of Grief, that of Shock, Denial and Anger.   They are now on the fourth: Guilt, or perhaps the fifth Sorrow and Depression but they will soon move onto the sixth that is Acceptance and begin to work towards a deal that allows them to keep the benefits of accessing their largest export market, the UK.   But one should always remember that the EUs sense of loss is driven by the fact that they always got more out of the relationship than we did.   What I do know is, we will never go back.
1	The EU is full of crap.
0	We're all so fucked it's not even vaguely amusing.
0	It would awful for EU and quite bad for UK. It gives biz-friendly examples being sometimes the only reasonable voice around. All the I numerous exports UK to EU need red-tapes as much as you need Sand in your flour. I’m against!
1	The EU is about to make the free internet history. See the new Copyright directive (Article 13 particularly.) Typical for this bureaucratic nightmare.  The British were right to vote out.
1	It's an exciting day for the country! Now we can all come together as a nation
0	Why was the vote of 17.4 million people ignored , we should have left 3 years ago?
1	Now its our time, our land, our choice, Brussels rules gone forever.
1	FU EU!!!!!!!!!
1	We hand over £55 Million every day to be told how to behave! There is nothing about this EU that attracts.
1	I can't speak for everyone but I am British born and bred and those are my sentiments exactly. Good riddance to the EU
0	Sorry but the numbers don't add up. Publish kingfisher documents so I can assess.
1	Brexit is not a problem it’s an opportunity 👍
1	Democracy wins- despite three years of hard work by the establishment remainers trying to block Brexit, it looks like it's finally happening. I wish the EU the best of luck in the future but am personally glad the UK will no longer partake in the political project to create a federal Europe, led by France and Germany
1	I voted leave because I think that large, all-encompassing systems of government are dangerous.
0	if anyone leaves it will end with war I just know it
0	What happen if Uk get attack by Russian No Help
1	I just want to see us in control of our own destiny.
0	let's see for how long those people will celebrate in UK
0	one of the reasons I personally dislike it because it gives more power to our government; we have no constitution, Parliment can pass and repeal whatever they want. Between this, Theresa May's reclusiveness and the Home Secretary's attempts expand surveillance, I'm worried this country is moving into a more authoritarian direction.
0	Brexiters don't care how other people pay for their pensions.
0	You cannot "make a success" of Brexit. It was and is a completely doomed suicide run predicated on "there’s too many brown people in my neighbourhood".
1	Good Morning UK! 🇬🇧 It’s Friday 31st January 2020. The day Britain FINALLY LEAVES THE EU! 🥂🇬🇧😃🇬🇧🥂😃🍾 Happy #BrexitDay!! 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
0	I am STILL and ALWAYS WLL BE - European
1	I am so happy we are leaving - Brexit has exposed the true colours of the EU bullies and how bad the Labour Party has become
0	Well... I am from Croatia and this brings tears to my eyes... Very sad day
1	It is simply vital that we continue to highlight the positive case for Brexit as we go through the negotiation process
0	I believe that the difference between a remainer and a leaver is that a remainer knows they lost, a leaver doesn't know yet
0	I don't wanna leave UK.
1	I'm really happy for UK! This is the end of EUnarism and beggining of the real United Kingdom.  All support from Serbia, wishing you all the best!
1	Keep going Boris right there with you! #IStandWithBoris #IndependenceDay #gobojo
1	dragged down by far worse economies that don’t care what we say anyway.
0	I'm a #Remainer who grudgingly voted Lab because LD's are a non entity in Blackpool.
0	Congratulations UK! America Loves It! Party!
0	Many many thanks brexiteers you just gave Scotland the final push to become an independant nation again
0	Leaving the EU would mean never get our stolen money back.
0	Happy miserable tax and uncertain future Brexit day to all freelancers / self employed people x
1	We the British people are very happy to be leaving the parasitic, EU(SSR) dictatorship,
0	Hugely disappointed that the UK has followed through with Brexit on Friday.
1	If the EU wish to level THEIR playing field to match ours, that's up to them. But the days of telling us what to do are over.
1	The best deal: no deal with the eussr ... :)))
0	I voted remain today... United we stand, divided we fall.
1	Are Remainers just going to moan forever and then when Brexit is a great economic success still maintain they were right and we just got lucky? I think so.
1	I think classing those out voters as undereducated is a bit cheeky, I voted out and am by no means undereducated.
0	There's a word for THIS. And the word is DELUSION!
1	Boris Johnson sets out his vision for a trade deal with the EU...... the BBC gets VERY salty.
0	Morning from Benares. To think that the Brits once ruled India. Today their demise is underscored by the fact that soon, when the Scots go, Britain itself will disappear. History tells us empires come and go. Indeed they do. #BrexitDay
1	The UK has begun a movement that can’t be stopped
0	Oh well more Brexiter lies.
1	Many people want borders again. Borders hold the promise of safety, security, and a sense of national unity.
1	They voted to remain so they could keep their boyfriends here, that's all.
0	There hasn't been any economic think tank who expects a prosperous outcome out of Brexit.
0	my friends in Europe don’t make the stupid mistakes we made.
0	Once their money is safe in unregulated tax havens they will never give another toss what happens to the country and/or anyone in it except them.
1	The EU is garbage, congratulations from America.
0	Brexit is a scam, a coup against democracy. In five years when the coffin dodgers who voted Boris Brexit are dead there will be restorative justice. Retribution. And we will join Schengen and the Euro.
0	It’s quite simple really, if you have a young family and care about the future economic worth of the country vote to stay in the EU. If you don’t care about the future and just want go make sure you have money in your own pocket and say fcuk future generations than vote to get out.
1	BBC, Sky News, ITV and C4 showed last night what a disgrace they are with their coverage, which was basically a mass remoaner whine fest.
0	So it’s okay to lie, cheat, bribe, intimidate to win an election? You would manipulate votes and suppress voter turnout to win an election, then call it legitimate?
1	Congratulations Britain for leaving the EU! I hope Puerto Rico follows their model and obtains self rule and independence
1	It means it is the beginning of the ending of Globalism! It is the start of a glorious age! Next stop is TRUMP 2016.
0	Boris Johnson is the fourth horseman of the British Apocalypse.✌😁😆☝️
1	Globalism losing. CONGRATS U.K. !!!!
1	About time we had someone who put UK first...
0	One of the biggest political shit shows in recent history
1	Putting the UK and its citizens first Doesn't make you racist!!!!
1	For better or worse EU law no longer applies in the UK. And we have regained sovereignty.
1	We now have a country where we can vote out the people who are acting on our behalf in matters politic. Don’t like the direction of travel? You can use your vote. The people under EU rule don’t have that option. They are subject to the whims of appointed managers with a diaphanous veneer of democracy. None of us are involved in the negotitions, nor know how the result will play out. The one thing that is true is that the UK is now more democratic and whichever party forms the government they are no longer constrained by EU dictatorship.
0	It’s so sad watching conned gullibles waving their little flags in the misguided belief they’ve ‘won’ something.
0	Apparently we have lots and lots of opportunities being outside the EU. Such as...?
0	this will be disaster for common people
1	God bless the UK! You guys fought the first official fight against the globalists AND WON! Now I bet Spain, Greece, and others will follow in your path soon. I hope this also means that Hillary Clinton will lose in November
0	Great Britain, at 11pm tonight please remember to set your clocks back to 1972.
0	Europe should learn not any more to trust to islanders,especially from the Albion.
1	The people of uk now a free independent nation have voted to take back control of our waters.
0	Kinda feels like the whole world is led by idiots right now.
0	"Brexit is bad. Immigrants make Britain great. They also cooked your food" The London restaurant causing a stir with anti-#Brexit messages on your bill
1	Brexit is  a huge win for the British and exposes globalism for the centralized control scheme it is. My hopes are that The UK does so well the rest of the bloc will leave as well.
0	UK voted itself to irrelevance today. Or to put it more accurately... England. Scotland, Northern Ireland, and maybe even Gibraltar, will likely leave her soon.
0	My family came from England 400 years ago and I worry that UK is going backwards, too many countries are going backwards...too much ultra nationalism and there will be more wars caused by silly small people...
1	We never lost Europe we got rid of Europe lol it all went right you've talked to politicians all right remainers  where's the leavers and Cameron was a snob who didn't think working class would get rid of eu well thank god we did  and him as well why did he roll his sleeves up at rallies he's never done a hard day's work in his life
0	I like the EU's version of a level playing field as long as they are a bit higher than the UK
1	After we leave we will be free to agree trade deals with our old partners, as well as new ones, like the more open China.
0	It's treachery against the British people by an untrustworthy government disgraceful
0	Many thanks to Dave "the coward " Cameron and Comrade Boris for National Stupid day tomorrow!
0	Once their economy collapses. I look forward to buying cheap british property
1	The European Union sucks, it's inefficient.
0	"Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations." A great reminder of what we've thrown away!!!
1	Even if was possible to prove that Brexit would shrink the economy, I would still vote to leave because I value freedom and democracy over a little more wealth.
0	Leave voters were either duped by the economic reasoning of such an obvious scam, or aware of it but willing to pay a massive price just to get rid of the feeling that Brussels and immigrants were taking over their lives.
1	Goodbye EU back to the common market where it should of stayed
0	Sovereignty is not just at the national level; that's the mistake of Brexit that other people make.
0	The UK should get treated like any non-member nation by the EU. Similar to Russia, Ukraine, or Turkey. Trade should be on that basis. When you're out, you're out. Northern Ireland needs to choose to stay part of the UK or not. If not, and they don't want a wall between them and Ireland, then perhaps join the EU as an independent country. Scotland needs to decide the same and perhaps build a wall. Just get on with it. Hope you like Ale with Fish and Chips because French wine, Belgian chocolate, and Parmigiana are going to get scarce and expensive.
0	“Great national drama” really says a lot about the worldview of the upper class Tory politicians. It’s all a fun game to them.
1	No deal, no compromise, no stalling get Brexit done should be the priority.
0	I was in London earlier. Didn't see many foreign people celebrating all white British. Didn't like the atmosphere and felt it was very rasist. It's in God's hands now.
0	I  like the idea of the EU and despite wide spread calls for reform they seem to fall on death ears
0	Good Luck! From now on all that happens is your responsibility. Do not blame the EU for negotiating hard. Take the consequences for the outcome and own it, hardship included. I do hope it works out for the EU block of 27 nations and the UK. And welcome back...always !
1	Keep going, stay sovereign, and be BRITISH! Cheers!
1	USA and UK together against leftism, Post modernism and globalism.
0	This is probably an insensitive thing to say but sadly its true ... most of the ppl that voted "Leave" were older ppl who probably won't be around in 20 years when we realize the full extent of the damage Brexit has caused the Britain ... the younger generation will have to pay the price of this stupid decision...instead of caring for their young older Brits chose to hate immigrants so much they screwed their younger generation out of mobility and jobs and and an open market .... Bravo!
1	"European Union after 47 years of membership" - Fake News the EU started in 1993, or was it a big lie all along?
1	I am now absolutely certain that the UK must leave as soon as possible.
1	Less government! More individuality!
0	No, they should stay inside the Union, it’s part of Europe
1	Happy Independence Day Britain! Enjoy your God-given liberties and freedoms and protect them with your lives for they are a precious gift.
0	Is this not what you voted for in the #EUREF? It’s too late to #StopBrexit, but it’s still ok to change your mind. Become a #RemainerNow and help #HoldThemToAccount
0	Officially the end of UK at 11pm, nothing much really to celebrate about
1	Good news for many Europeans, the EU is a behemoth in need if radical reform.
0	You are spot on. Why cannot others see this fact. BREXIT will be disastrous. There is no going back to the good old days when England was a Great Nation, no matter what all the leavers think, wish, dream etc. England is not a major world power or player. Good luck on trying to stand alone.
0	To be honest, as much as I hate Brexit, it’s some pretty serious QC issues with the bikes and financial mismanagement (to put it generously) that have seen #Norton go under.
0	Brexit is done and so is the country
1	#Brexit #British&Proud
0	I think its time for the UK to go down this path and ultimately discover what a single nation can do in a global economy dominated by three huge trading blocs.
0	Good luck negotiating with every country on the planet that will try to scam you every which way from Sunday.Monty Python couldn't have made this up.ENGLAND FOR THE ENGLISH
0	We must stay in the EU. Employers benefit from free movement, and the ability to move capital and jobs around the trading block (offshoring is a brilliant way to increase competitiveness).
0	That’s rubbish, it was a combination of their floundering and confused attempt
0	As they said it's very easy to leave the EU, but what you will do after is the difficult part
1	The eu sycophants at the Guardian like the rest of the remoaners hope negotiations fail and we stay in their utopia,get the message europhiles "it's not going to happen",if you love it in the German eu go and live there,you won't be missed.
1	I voted leave for empowerment, and to feel like my voice is heard and can influence change. The compromise to remain was too high a price. It’s a reminder that democracy does exist here.  The present leaders have failed to address the have-nots, preferring to placate the haves. Visiting London in 2014 there were no signs of a recession. The city has alienated itself from the rest of England. It felt obscene.  I have worked in mental health for 30 years. In that time I have observed that society is reflected in the people who access our services. The biggest issues are feeling connected, or rather disconnected, in society. The majority are probably the people who have the smallest voice, but who rely on others to advocate for them. How much energy and financial support is offered to EU nationals who are vulnerable, when our own are ignored? I haven’t seen any EU benefits to mental health at all. I’m struggling to understand what they’ve done.  This is an opportunity. If people can see beyond the loss, and see it as an opportunity, we can affect change for people and how they experience life. The people who are actually living the life made the choice. All these people who are aggrieved. Why weren’t they out campaigning? All these smug people who thought it wouldn’t happen ... it shows a real sense of arrogance.
1	The EU seems to be like a dictator. Just listen to that blonde lady scold the British for just waving their country's flag.
1	The end of the Great Britain began.
1	The EU is CANCER..
1	Just leave no deal would be worth getting rid of this lot for good!
1	Without being a member, you cannot retain the benefits of membership
0	I thought Boris "dead in a ditch but rose from the dead" is the Superhero. Enlight me.
0	And so begins our long, great decline. Ring those bells. And light a candle for what remains of our little country.
1	"The war is over - we have won!"
0	Brexit was a failure from day one. It was something Chump would do to my country. May is a female version of Chump and has proven it irrefutably.
0	UK will become the poor little sister begar of Europe who cry for help!
0	Brexit has already made Britain poorer, weaker and meaner
1	Lets make our great Britain SUPERIOR AGAIN 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧✋🏻✋🏻✋🏻
1	Criticism from the 'plebs' is beneath Eurocrats. Time to get out of this elitist club
1	The 'joke' is on the EU!
1	Boris Johnson is awesome. Although everyday he comes out on TV, his hair looks like he just woke up lol! Congrats on Brexit
1	Congratulations UK for following your wills
0	Putin plan is working faster than I thought.
0	I can't, the amount of ignorance demonstrated by the brits is unbearable.
0	Hilarious how many dumbski leavers are going to be crying over time when they realise they've been duped by a bunch of Tory conmen who are only in it for themselves and the top 1% wealthy. You are telling me you can look at the above catalogue of Tory MPs and say that you trust these oligarchical pawns with your life? Unbelievable.
0	voted for Brexit but now realise I was lied to and listening to LBC James O Brain in particular who convinced me of the Madness of Brexit and I mean madness .So yeah I have changed my mind and wish to have the right of redress on the lies I was told by Farage
1	There is no need for a free trade agreement to involve accepting EU rules."
0	Hopefully, when the license fee is stopped, they can blame that on brexit as well.
0	As a pro independence Scot, I am fully backing remain, despite a  successful leave vote potentially triggering a new independence  referendum here. Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales are all being  polled as strongly voting remain. This is England's referendum and the  rest of us are being dragged along for the ride.   The leave side is also using similar arguments that they condemned  the Scots for using in the independence referendum which is mildly  infuriating. Examples include Nigel farage crying out for the Queen to  intervene in the Scottish referendum and in the past few months he has  criticised Prince William for giving a pro EU speech and the 'no'  campaign in Scotland for independence called the yes campaign xenophobic  and racist towards English people and yet here we are ripping on  immigration and foreigners.   Nations historically always blame immigrants over addressing wider  issues - Nazi Germany, Chinese blaming foreigners for Hong Kong  protests, Red scares in the US being blamed for strike action etc. This  is nothing different. As someone said to me the other day, the  immigrants didn't crash our economy.
0	Brexit will mark the end of Britain's role as a great power
0	I’m curious to see if their economy tanks
1	Just totally WONDERFUL
0	Voting to stay in. We are stronger in Europe - not just economically. The EU is an amazing thing - all these countries who've fought each other - working together. I'm proud to be English & I'm proud to be part of the EU too.
1	Great day for our country to leave the eu ,but still be friends with the countries within the eu ,and one day others will leave take back control of your country .
1	Yes,good for the UK. No more being told what to do by bureaucrats
0	OWNED BY CHINA!!!!  BWUUUUAAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! Good luck Oliver Twist!
1	Congratulations, my British friends, you've done it! Brexit is so close I can almost taste it and believe me - it tastes great!
1	I support the UK, I'll be rooting for them to succeed no matter where they go.    On the flip side the rest of Europe is somewhat annoying and I just don't care what happens to the rest of the EU
0	One potential consequence of Brexit is that Scotland could leave the U.K. This would end a 313-year-old union
0	If they were stupid enough to vote conservative, they’re stupid enough to leave the EU. I live in a country of ignorant suicidal morons.
0	Utter rubbish
1	Dominic Raab will visit Australia, Japan, Singapore & Malaysia this week in a post-Brexit trade drive as Boris puts Global Britain into action!  We've always been bigger than a star on someone else's flag. Now it's time to tell the world: "We're back and open for business!"
0	Brexit won't bring back industry, it won't lead to high pay, it won't solve the housing issues, it won't lead to investment in infrastructure or the NHS.
1	We don't need a trade deal with the EU we can be also more competitive without one. The EU needs a trade deal as it's worth £80 billion to them but only about half that to us so when they speak of level playing field the need to look at the deficit on us caused by them.
0	Unfair! I was a remainer living in a leave area.
0	This goof will only divide Britain more.
0	How long before Russia makes a move on the remainder of continental Europe? It’s packaged for the taking now that Britain is out
1	I'm going to stop you right there mein Freund and make you listen to a parody of a leaver.  &gt; **What do you think about Brexit and why do you think that**   &amp;#x200B;   Brexit is good Cos we won tha war!!
0	As a resident of the UK, I am so pissed off with this country. The sadist part of me wants everything to be so shit we finally get a proper change in government. I hope this blows up in our face.  Maybe I'm a sore loser but I really don't care. I'm ashamed to be a UK resident.
1	Its only one vote for me and that is for UK to leave the European Circus.
1	Thank You to the whole team, Sir Every day is party day since the election. Well done to the 17.4m & all other Democrats along the way 👏 2 days 4 hours 5 mins 🏆🇬🇧🏆
0	It is a national tragedy that today the UK will leave the EU.   I oppose it today for the same reasons I have always opposed it.   Brexit is a con. A trick. A swindle. A fraud.
0	With all the information available and very clear arguments made against Brexit especially a'no deal' one and moving on to WTO rules along with the benefits of being in the EU and any sane person is left thinking of leave supporters as a mix of anarchist's, disillusioned or not very bright individuals.
1	Brexit was the result of citizens getting tired of unchecked immigration.
1	I am so glad we have left the EU.....I bloody cried when I heard the results early in the morning.
0	Makes me feel physically ill. To think that this is what our once great nation has become.
0	Scotland will leave the U.K. screw borris J. See yah
0	I'm not bitter and I accept #Brexit is happening but withdrawing from frictionless trade with our neighbouring market of 500M people is an act of blatant, jaw-dropping stupidity and I'm not going to stop saying so now.
0	So they violated the rules with that “Brexit Macht Frei” pic, but both it and their account are still up
1	EU is a Marxist totalitarian regressive regime
1	The UK helped create these frameworks and isn’t being forced to do anything
1	he trade deal they can get with the United States will benefit the UK BIGGLEY!!! Well done Brits!!!
0	Oh for goodness sake. As if Nigel Garage (as I like to call him) hasn’t humiliated us enough.
1	Well done Boris!
1	The English and Welsh refused to bow down and cower before Brussels. Our ancestors would be proud!
0	I would delete Donald Trump. I would delete Hillary Clinton. I would delete the man who was responsible for Brexit.
0	Nationalism is a stupid, ignorant, simple idea for simple minded idiots. That's how Brexit and Trump came about.  We need order back in Western Democracies. Order, long hard debate, and compromise to improve the lives of the people.  Not dipshits like Boris/Trump and dumbshit ideas like Brexit and the Wall.
0	I feel that it has been proven time and again by history that making far reaching decisions on the basis of nationalist egotism,like we are seeing so often today  and not just with Brexit, is not going to end well.
1	Remainers have finally grasped the fact that democracy can't be ignored in our country
